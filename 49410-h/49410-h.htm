<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Till within the last few years but little attention
appears to have been paid in England to Castilian
verse. Our earliest poets of eminence, Chaucer
and Lord Surrey, struck at once into the rich
field of Italian song, and by their imitations of
Petrarch and Boccaccio, most probably set the
fashion to their successors, of the exclusive study
which they gave to the same models, to the
neglect of the cotemporary writers of other nations,
to those at least of Spain. Nor is this partiality
to the one and neglect of the other to be at all
wondered at; for neither could they have gone
to more suitable sources than the Tuscans for
the harmony and grace which the language in
its first aspirations after refinement wanted, nor
did the Spanish poetry of that period offer more
to recompense the researches of the student than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
dry legends, historical ballads, or rude imitations
of the Vision of Dante. But it is a little singular
that this inattention should have continued
when the influence of the Emperor Charles the
Fifth became great in the courts of Europe, and
the Spanish language, chastised into purity and
elegance by Bosc&aacute;n, Garcilasso, and their immediate
successors, obtained a currency amongst the
nations correspondent with the extent of his conquests.
The hostile attitude in which England
stood to Spain under Elizabeth, may be regarded
as perhaps the principal cause why we meet in the
constellation of writers that gave lustre to her
reign, with so few traces of their acquaintance with
the literature of that country; whilst the strong
jealousy of the nation to Spanish influence, catholicism,
and jesuitical intrigue, no less than the purely
controversial spirit of the times, had, I doubt not,
their full effect under the Stuarts, in deterring the
scholars of that period from any close communion
with her poets. Meanwhile the corruption of style
which had so baneful an effect on her literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
was silently going forward under Gongora, Quevedo,
and their numerous imitators. Before the reign of
Philip the Fifth, this corruption had reached its
height; his accession to the crown of Spain, and
the encouragement he gave to letters, might have re-established
the national literature in its first lustre,
if the evil had not struck root so deeply, and if another
cast of corrupters had not opposed themselves to the
views of this monarch, viz. the numerous translators
of French works, who disfigured the idiom by
forming a French construction with native words.
Thus the curiosity of the poets of Queen Anne's
time, if it was ever excited, must have been speedily
laid asleep; and (though we may notice in Dryden,
and perhaps in Donne, a study of Castilian,) it was
scarcely before the middle of the last century that
this study began permanently to tinge our literature.
To Mr. Hayley, who first directed public attention
to the great merits of Dante, must be ascribed the
praise also of first calling our notice in any great
degree to the Spanish poets. Southey followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
and by his "Chronicle of the Cid" and "Letters
from Spain," quickened the curiosity excited by
Mr. Hayley's analysis and translated specimens of
the Araucana of Ercilla. Lord Holland's admirable
dissertation on the genius and writings of Lope de
Vega, gave us a clearer insight into the literature of
Spain, whilst the French invasion brought us into
a more intimate connexion and acquaintance with
her chivalrous people; nor could the many English
visitants which this drew to her shores view the
remains which she keeps of Arabian and Moorish
magnificence, or even listen to her language, which
preserves such striking vestiges of oriental majesty,
without having their imagination led back to her
days of literary illumination, and without deriving
some taste for the productions of her poets. The
struggle which she then made, and that which she is
now making, first against the unhallowed grasp of
foreign coercion, and next of that priestly tyranny
which has so long cramped her political and intellectual
energies, have excited in every British bosom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
the most cordial sympathy; and it is evident that
from these causes, there is a growing attention
amongst us to her language and literature. Since
the present volume was begun, a translation has
appeared of the excellent work of Bouterewek, on
Spanish and Portuguese poetry; another is going
through the press of Sismondi "Sur la Litt&eacute;rature
du Midi de l'Europe;" and Mr. Lockhart has just
given us a choice selection of those beautiful old
Spanish ballads, which, as Mr. Rogers observes of
the narratives of the old Spanish chroniclers, 'have
a spirit like the freshness of waters at the fountain
head, and are so many moving pictures of the
actions, manners, and thoughts of their cotemporaries;'
like rough gems redeemed from an
oriental mine, they have assumed under his hand a
polish and a price that must render them indispensable
to the cabinets of our men of taste. Nor, in
speaking of those whose labours have tended to
spread a knowledge of Hesperian treasure, must
we pass over without due praise the masterly
notices on Spanish poetry, which Mr. Frere and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Mr. Bowring are understood to have given forth in
the Quarterly and Restrospective Reviews.</p>

<p>In this situation of things, it may not be wholly
unacceptable to the public to receive, though from an
inferior hand, a translation of Garcilasso de la Vega,
the chastest and perhaps the most celebrated of the
poets of Castile. A desire to vary the nature of my
pursuits, with other reasons not necessary to mention,
first led me to his pages; but the pleasure I derived
at the outset from his pastoral pictures and harmony
of language, soon settled into the more
serious wish to make his merits more generally
known, and thus to multiply his admirers amongst
a people ever inclined, sooner or later, to do justice
to foreign talent. I would, however, deprecate any
undue expectations that may be raised by the high
title bestowed on Garcilasso by his countrymen&mdash;a
title conferred in their enthusiastic admiration of
his success in giving suddenly so new and beautiful
an aspect to the art, and in elevating their language
to a point of perfection, truly surprising, if we consider
all the circumstances connected with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
revolution; but this peculiar merit, so far at least
as relates to the language, must necessarily from
its nature be wholly untranslateable, and he is thus
compelled to lose much of the consideration with
the merely English reader that is his real due. But
it would be unjust in an English reader, who
glances over the subjects of his fancy, to conclude
that because Garcilasso has written little but
Eclogues and Sonnets, compositions, he may say,
at best but of inferior order, he is therefore worthy
of but little regard in this age of poetical wonders.
I will be bold to assert, that the poets, and readers
of the poets of the day, will be no way degraded
by coming in contact with his simplicity: our
taste for the wilder flights of imagination has
reached a height from which the sooner we
descend to imitate the nature and unassuming ease
of simpler lyrists&mdash;the Goldsmiths and Garcilassos
of past ages, the better it may chance to be both for
our poetry and language. Nor let the name of
Eclogues affright the sensitive reader that has in his
recollection the Colins and Pastoras that sickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
his taste some thirty or forty years ago. The
pastorals, as they were called, of that period, are
no more to be compared with the <i>rime boschereccie</i>
of Garcilasso, than the hideous distortion of the
leaden Satyr that squirts water from its nostrils in
some city tea-garden, and that is pelted at irresistibly
by every boy that passes,&mdash;with the marble
repose and inviolable beauty of the Piping Faun in
a gallery of antique sculptures.</p>

<p>Whilst employed on this translation, I was struck
with the lucid view which Quintana gives, in the
Essay prefixed to his "Poesias selectas Castellanas,"
of the History of Spanish Poetry, and I
thought that it might be made yet more serviceable
to the end which its author had in view, by a
translation that would disclose to the English
reader what he might expect from a cultivation of
the Spanish language. The only fault perhaps
of this Essay is, that Quintana has judged his
native poets too strictly and exclusively by the
rules of French criticism and French taste, which
ought not I think to be applied as tests to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
literature so wholly national as the Spanish is, so
especially coloured by the revolutions that have
taken place upon the Spanish soil, and so utterly
unlike that of any other European nation. Still the
Essay will be found, if I mistake not, as interesting
and instructive to others as it has proved to me:
from it a more compact and complete view of the
art in Spain may be gathered, than from more
extensive histories of the kind; nor was I uninfluenced
in my purpose by the advantage which
the judgment of a native, himself one of the most
distinguished of the living poets and lettered
men of Spain, would have over any original Essay
derived from the writings of foreigners, who, whatever
may be their critical sagacity and literary
repute, can neither be supposed to be so intimately
acquainted with the compositions of which
they treat, nor such good judges of Castilian
versification.</p>

<p>It is time to conclude these prefatory observations;
yet I cannot forego the pleasure of first
acknowledging the great advantage I have derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
from the kind revision of my MSS. by the Rev.
Blanco White. That gentleman's desire to aid in
any thing that might seem to serve the reputation
of his country&mdash;the country, whose customs and
institutions he has pourtrayed with such vivid
interest, originality, and talent, joined to his native
goodness of heart, could alone have led him to
volunteer his services, in a season of sickness,
to one nearly a stranger; and if I submit the
following pages to the public with any degree of
confidence in its favour, it is from the many improvements
to which his friendly and judicious
criticisms have led.</p>

<p>To Mr. Heber also, who, with the spirit of a
nobleman, throws open so widely the vast stores of
his invaluable library, I feel bound to express my
obligations for the use of Herrera's rare edition
of the works of Garcilasso, which I had in vain
sought for in other collections of Spanish books,
both public and private: his voluntary offer of this,
on a momentary acquaintance, enhances in my
mind the value of the favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The astonishing number of authors which the
Bibliotheca Hispanica of Don Nicol&aacute;s Antonio
displays, is a sufficient proof of the great intellect
that Spain would be capable of putting forth, if her
mind had a play proportioned to its activity. No
nation has given to the light so many and such
weighty volumes upon Aristotle, so many eminent
writers in scholastic theology, so many and such
subtle moral casuists, or so many profound commentators
on the Codices and Pandects. And if
she has produced these works in ages when the
withering influence of political and religious despotism,
like the plant which kills the sylvan it
embraces, searched into every coigne of her literary
fabric, what may not be expected from her,
when the present distractions, fomented by the
accursed gold of France, are composed into tranquillity,
and the inquiries of her talented men
embrace under free institutions a wider range of
science than they have yet dared to follow, except
by stealth! There is not one lettered Englishman
but will rejoice with his whole heart when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
winged Genius that is seen in Quintana's poems,
chained to the gloomy threshold of a Gothic building,
looking up with despondency to the Temple
of the Muses, may be represented soaring away
for ever from the irons that have eaten into its
soul.&mdash;</p>

<p>The present work will be shortly followed by a
Spanish Anthology, containing translations of the
choicest Specimens of the Castilian Poets, with
short biographical notices, and a selection of the
Morisco ballads.</p>

<h2>ESSAY ON SPANISH POETRY.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

OF THE ORIGIN OF SPANISH POETRY, AND ITS PROGRESS TO JUAN DE MENA.</h3>

<p>To poetry is given by general assent the first place
amongst the imitative arts. Whether we regard the
antiquity of its origin, the range of objects which it
embraces, the duration and pleasure of its impressions,
or the good it produces, we must be struck alike with
its dignity and importance; and the history of its
advances must ever go hand in hand with that of the
other branches of human improvement. It is said that
poetry and music civilized the nations; and this proposition,
which, rigorously examined, is exaggerated, and
even false, shows at least the influence that both have
had in the formation of society. The lessons given by
the first philosophers to men, the first laws, the most
ancient systems, all were written in verse; whilst the
fancy of the poets, the flattering pictures and pomp of
rites, which they invented, interrupted, with a pleasing
and necessary relaxation, the fatigue of rural labours.</p>

<p>It is true that poetry does not afterwards present
itself with the dignity attendant upon the absolute and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
exclusive exercise of these various services; yet it preserves
an influence so great in our instruction, in our
moral perfection, and our pleasures, that we may consider
it as a dispenser of the same benefits, though
under different forms. It serves as an attraction to
make truth amiable, or as a veil to screen her; it
instructs infancy in the schools, awakens and directs
the sensibilities of youth, ennobles the spirit with its
maxims, sublimes it with its pictures, strews with
flowers the path of virtue, and unbars to heroism the
gates of glory. So many advantages, united with
charms so fascinating, have excited in mankind an
admiration and a gratitude eternal.</p>

<p>Its primary and essential business is to paint nature
for our delight, as that of philosophy is to explain her
phenomena for our instruction. Thus, whilst the
philosopher, observing the stars, inquires into their
proportions, their distances, and the laws of their
motion, the poet contemplates and transfers to his
verses the impression they make upon his fancy and
feelings, the lustre with which they shine, the harmony
that reigns amongst them, and the benefits which they
dispense to the earth. The difficulty of fulfilling
worthily and well the object of poetry is extreme,
even though, considering the rapid progress which it
sometimes makes, it might appear easy. From the
vague maxim or insipid tale, rendered vigorous by the
charm of an uncertain rhyme or rude measure, to the
harmony and sustained elegance of the Iliad or Eneid;
from the waggon and winelees of Thespis to the grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
spectacle offered by the <i>Iphig&eacute;nie</i> or <i>Tancr&egrave;de</i>, the
distance is immense, and can only be overcome by the
greatest efforts of application and genius.</p>

<p>Some nations, the favourites of Heaven, accomplish
it with more promptitude, and pass quickly from the
feebleness of first essays to the vigour of thoughts
more grand, and combinations more perfect. Such
was the case with Greece, where the genius of poetry,
scarcely numbering a few moments of infancy, grew and
raised itself to the height of producing the immortal
poesies of Homer. Such, though with less brilliancy
and perfection, was the case with modern Italy, where
in the midnight of the barbarous ages that succeeded
Roman refinement, appeared on the sudden Dante
and Petrarch, bringing with them the dawn of the arts
and of good taste. Other nations, less fortunate,
wrestle entire centuries with rudeness and ignorance,
and become more slowly sensible to the blandishments
of elegance and harmony; and perfection, in the
degree that men can attain it, is conquered by them
solely by force of time and toil. This is found to be
the case with the greater number of modern nations,
and amongst them, we must of necessity mention
Spain.</p>

<p>In Spain, as in almost all countries, written verse was
anterior to prose; the <i>Poem of the Cid</i> having appeared,
being the first known book in Castilian, as well as
the first work of poetry. In the midst of the confusion
of languages caused by the invasion of the northern
barbarians, the Romance, which was afterwards to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
be presented with so much splendour and majesty
in the writings of Garcilasso, Herrera, Rioja, Cervantes,
and Mariana, was assuming a definite form.
Considering the work for the argument alone, few
would have the advantage over it, at the same time
that few warriors might dispute with Rodrigo de Bivar
the palm of prowess and heroism. His glory, which
eclipsed that of all the kings of his time, has been
transmitted from age to age down to the present, by
means of the infinite variety of fables which ignorant
admiration has accumulated in his history. Consigned
to poems, to tragedies, to comedies, to popular songs,
his memory, like that of Achilles, has had the fortune to
strike forcibly and occupy the fancy; but the Castilian
hero, superior without doubt to the Greek in strength
and in virtue, has not had the advantage of meeting
with a Homer.</p>

<p>It was not possible to meet with one at the period
when the rude writer of that poem sat down to compose
it. With a language altogether uncouth, harsh in its
terminations, vicious in its construction, naked of all
culture and harmony; with a versification devoid of
any certain measure and marked rhymes, and a style
full of vicious pleonasms and ridiculous puerilities,
destitute of the graces with which imagination and
elegance adorn it; how was it possible to produce a
work of genuine poetry, that should sweetly occupy the
mind and ear? The writer is not however so wanting
in talent, as not to manifest from time to time some
poetic design, now in invention, now in sentiment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
now in expression. If, as Don Tomas Sanchez, the
editor of this and other poems previous to the fifteenth
century, suspects, there be wanting to that of the Cid
merely a few verses at the beginning, it is surely a
mark of judgment in the author that he disencumbered
his work of all the particulars of his hero's life anterior
to his banishment by Alfonso the Sixth. There the
true glory of Rodrigo begins, and there the poem commences;
relating afterwards his wars with the Moors
and with the Count of Barcelona, his conquests, the
taking of Valencia, his reconciliation with the king, the
affront offered to his daughters by the Infantes of
Carrion, the solemn reparation and vengeance which the
Cid took for it, and his union with the royal houses of
Arragon and Navarre, with which the work finishes,
slightly indicating the epoch of the hero's death. In
the course of his story, the writer is not wanting in
vivacity and interest, great use of the dialogue, which is
a point most to the purpose in animating the narration,
and in occasional pictures that are not without
merit in their art and composition. Such, amongst
others, is the farewell of Rodrigo and Ximena, in the
church of San Pedro de Carde&ntilde;a, when he departs to
fulfil the royal mandate. Ximena, prostrate on the
steps of the altar where divine service is celebrated,
makes a prayer to the Eternal in behalf of her husband,
which concludes thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Oh God, thou art the King of kings, and Sire of all mankind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee I adore, in thee I trust with all my heart and mind;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><span class="i0">And to divine San Pedro pray to help me in praying still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wilt shield my noble Cid the Campeador from ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since we now must part, again to my embrace restore!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her orison thus made, high mass is offered, and is o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They leave the church, they mount their barbs&mdash;with sad and solemn pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cid to Donna Ximena went to take a last embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Donna Ximena, she bent down to kiss the hand of the Cid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sore weeping with her bright black eyes, she knew not what she did;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned, and kissed his little girls with all a father's love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Bless you, my girls,' he said, 'I you commend to God above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To your sweet mother and ghostly sire! When we shall meet again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God only knows, but now we part.' Not one could say Amen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, weeping in a way that none e'er saw the like, at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They part like nail from finger torn with agonizing strength.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Cid with his vassals thought to ride, and took the onward track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting for all, his plumed head he evermore turned back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out then, with gallant unconcern, Don Alvar Fanez spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Come, come, my Cid, what means all this? cheer up for goodness' sake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In happy hour of woman born! fast wears the morn away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since we must go, let us begone, nor dally with delay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happier time shall turn to joy the very ills we rue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God, who has given us souls to feel, shall give us counsel too.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is doubtless a great distance between this parting
and that of Hector and Andromache in the Iliad,
but the picture of a hero's sensibility at the time of
separation from his family is always pleasing; beautiful
is that turning of his head when at a distance, and fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the idea that those same warriors to whom he gives in
battle an example of fortitude and constancy, should
then fortify and cheer him. Superior, in my opinion,
for art and dramatic effect, is the act of accusation
which the Cid makes against his traitor sons-in-law
before the Cortes assembled to receive it. The first
shock of the Infantes and the champions of Rodrigo in
the lists has much animation and even style.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They grasp their shields before their hearts; down, down their lances go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed are their crested helms until they touch the saddle-bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fiercely they strike their horses' sides with streaming rowels red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And onward to the encounter run: earth trembles to their tread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span style="letter-spacing:4em;">&nbsp;****</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don Martin Antolinez, with the drawing of his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illumined all the field.&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No record is left for us to ascertain who was the
author of this first faint breath of Spanish poetry.
Two writers flourished in the following age, in whom
we trace the improvement and progress which the
versification and language had now made. In the
sacred poems of Don Gonzalo de Berc&eacute;o, and in the
<i>Alexandro</i> of Juan Lorenzo, are discovered more
fluency, more connexion, and forms more determinate.
The march of these authors, although difficult, is not
so trailing and jejune as that of the preceding poet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
The difference that subsists between the two later
poets is, that Berc&eacute;o, if we except his narrative and
some of his moral counsels, shows neither copiousness
of erudition, variety of knowledge, nor fancy for invention;
a deficiency arising from the nature of his subjects,
which for the most part turn upon legends of the saints.
Juan Lorenzo, on the contrary, is more rapt with his
subject, and manifests an information so extensive in
history, mythology, and moral philosophy, as to make
his work the most important of all that were written in
that age. The following verses on the same subject
may serve to show the style of both.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I, hight Gonzalo de Berc&eacute;o, going<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On pilgrimage, came one day to a mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green, and well-peopled with fair plants, which blowing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Made it a place desirable indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a tired traveller; the sweet-scented flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gave forth a smell that freshened not alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men's faces, but their fancies, whilst in showers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clear flowing fountains to the sky were thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each singing to itself as on it rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm in midwinter, and in summer cold."<br /></span>
<span class="i37"><span class="smcap">Berc&eacute;o.</span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was the month of May, a glorious tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When merry music make the birds in boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dressed are the meads with beauty far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sighs the ladye that has not a spouse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tide sweet for marriages; flowers and fresh winds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Temper the clime; in every village near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young girls in bevies sing, and with blythe minds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make each to each good-wishes of the year.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><span class="i0">Young maids and old maids, all are out of doors,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Are good&mdash;and the most tender deem the best."<br /></span>
<span class="i37"><span class="smcap">Lorenzo.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Alfonso the Tenth was then reigning in Castile; a
prince, to whom, to render his glory complete, fortune
ought to have given better sons, and vassals less
ferocious. Posterity has given him the surname of
The Wise; and beyond all doubt it was merited by the
extraordinary man, who in an age of darkness could
unite in himself the paternal and beneficent regards of
the legislator, the profound combinations of the mathematician
and astronomer, the talent and knowledge of
the historian, and the laurels of the poet. He it was
who raised his native language to its due honours,
when he gave command that the public instruments,
which before were engrossed in Latin, should be
written in Spanish. Mariana, less favourable to his
merits, asserts that this measure was the cause of the
profound ignorance that afterwards ensued. But
what was known before? The Latin then in use
was as barbarous, was yet more barbarous than the
Romance. The new uses to which the Romance was
applied by that decree, the dignity and authority it
acquired, influenced its culture, its polish, and its progress.
Can it by any chance be believed that these
advantages of the language had no literary influence,
or that there can be diffused knowledge and a national
literature, whilst the native language remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>uncultivated? The assertion of Mariana then must be considered
as a result of the somewhat pedantic prejudices
of the age in which he lived; but, even leaving
out of consideration the political convenience of the
law, let us regard it as one of the causes, which
having had an influence on the improvement of the
language, must necessarily have influenced also the
advancement of Spanish poetry.</p>

<p>There is an entire book of <i>Cantigas</i> or <i>Letras</i> to be
sung, composed in the Galician dialect by this king,
specimens of which are to be seen in the <i>Anales de
Sevilla</i> of Ortiz de Zu&ntilde;iga; another entitled <i>El Tesoro</i>,
which is a treatise on the philosopher's stone, as far as
can be judged, for to the present day a great part
remains undeciphered; and to him likewise is attributed
that of <i>Las Querellas</i>, of which two stanzas only are
preserved. Both are written in verses of twelve syllables,
with rhymes crossed like those of the sonnet, to
which is given the name of <i>coplas de arte mayor</i>, and
which was a real improvement in Spanish poetry; as
the rhythm of the Alexandrine verse, the measure used
both by Berc&eacute;o and Lorenzo, was insufferable from its
heaviness and monotony. Let us compare the coplas
with which the book <i>El Tesoro</i> commences, with the
stanzas alluded to.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The strange intelligence then reached my ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the land of Egypt lived a man,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A yearning toward this sage inspired my pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tongue that instant, with humility<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descending from my height of majesty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such mastery has a strong desire o'er men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My earnest prayers I wrote&mdash;I sent&mdash;with ten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My noblest envoys, loaded each apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gold and silver, which with all my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I offered him, but the request was vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With much politeness the wise man replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'You, sire, are a great king, and I should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most glad to serve you, but in the rich fee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of gold and gems I take no sort of pride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deign, then, yourself to use them; I abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Content in more abundant wealth; and may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your treasures profit you in every way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I can wish, your servant.' I complied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sent the stateliest of my argosies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which reached, and from the Alexandrian port<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought safe this cunning master to my court,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Have highly honoured him these many years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For honour is the birthright of the wise.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The two coplas with which the book of <i>Las Querellas</i>
began, are altogether superior in style, harmony, and
elegance.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>There seems to be a century between verse and
verse, between language and language; but what is
yet more remarkable, to meet with <i>coplas de arte mayor</i>
of equal merit, as well in diction as in cadence, we
must overleap almost two centuries more, and look for
them in Juan de Mena.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>If the impulse which this great king gave to letters
had been continued by his successors, Spanish literature
would not only be two centuries forwarder, but
would have produced more works, and those more
perfect. The ferocious character of the times did not
allow it. The fire of civil war began to blaze in the last
years of Alfonso, with the disobedience and rebellion of
his son, and continued, almost without intermission, for
a whole century, till it arrived at the last pass of atrocity
and horror in the tempestuous and terrible reign of Pedro.
The Castilians, during this unhappy period, seem to
have had no spirit but for hatred, no arms but for
destruction. How was it possible, amidst the agitation
of such turbulent times, for the torch of genius to shine
out tranquilly, or for the songs of the muses to be
heard? Thus only a very scanty number of poets can
be named as flourishing then: Juan Ruiz, archpriest of
Hita; the Infante Don Juan Manuel, author of <i>Conde
Lucan&oacute;r</i>; the Jew, Don Santo; and Ayala, the historiographer.
The verses of these writers are some of them
lost, others exist wholly unedited, and those only of
the archpriest of Hita have seen the light, which, fortunately,
are the most worthy, perhaps, of being known.
The subject of his poems is the history of his loves,
interspersed with apologues, allegories, tales, satires,
proverbs, and even devotions. This author surpassed
all former writers; and but few of those by whom he
was succeeded, excelled him in faculty of invention,
in liveliness of fancy and talent, or in abundance of
jests and wit; and if he had taken care to choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
or to follow more determinate and fixed metres, and
had his diction been less uncouth and cumbrous, this
work would have been one of the most curious monuments
of the Middle Age. But the uncouthness of
the style makes the reading insufferable. Of his versification
and manner, let the following verses serve as
specimens, in which the poet begs of Venus to interpose
her influence with a lady whom he loved, who was,
according to his pencil,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of figure very graceful, with an amorous look, correct,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet, lovely, full of frolic, mild, with mirth by prudence checked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caressing, courteous, lady-like, in wreathed smiles bedecked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom every body looks upon with love and with respect.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady Venus, wife of Love, at thy footstool low I kneel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art the paramount desire of all, thy force all feel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Love! thou art the master of all creatures; all with zeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worship thee for their creator, or for sorrow or for weal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings, dukes, and noble princes, every living thing that is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear and serve thee for their being; oh, take not my vows amiss!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulfil my fair desires, give good fortune, give me bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be not niggard, shy, nor harsh; sweet Venus, grant me this!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am so lost, so ruined, and so wounded by thy dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I carry close concealed and buried deep in my sad heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As not to dare reveal the wound; I dare not e'en impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her name; ere I forget her, may I perish with the smart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have lost my lively colour, and my mind is in decay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have neither strength nor spirits, I fall off both night and day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My eyes are dim, they serve alone to lead my steps astray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou do not give me comfort, I shall swoon and pass away."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>
<p>Venus, amongst other counsels, says to him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tell all thy feelings without fear or being swayed by shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every amorous-looking miss, to every gadding dame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst a thousand, thou wilt scarce find one that e'er will blame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine unembarrassed suit, nor laugh to scorn thy tender flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the first wave of the rough sea, when it comes roaring near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should frighten the rude mariner, he ne'er would plough the clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his brass-beaked ship; then ne'er let the first word severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first frown, or the first repulse, affright thee from thy dear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By cunning hardest hearts grow soft, walled cities fall; with care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High trees are felled, grave weights are raised; by cunning many swear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By cunning many perjured are, and fishes by the snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are taken under the green wave; then why shouldst thou despair?"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Other passages much more striking might be quoted;
and amongst them the description of the power of
money, which has a severity and freedom, of which it
would be difficult to find examples in other writers of that
time, either in or out of Spain, though the independent
Dante were to enter into the comparison; or the facetious
apology and praise of little women, which begins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wish to make my speeches suit the season,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Short; for I always liked, the more I read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short sermons, little ladies, a brief reason;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We fructify on little and well said,
&amp;c.<a name="ENanchor_1" id="ENanchor_1"></a><a href="#Endnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the examples already quoted will suffice for our
assertion. Sometimes the poet, weary perhaps of
monotony and heaviness, varies from the measure which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
he generally uses, and introduces another combination
of rhymes in songs which he mingles with his narrative;
as, for instance, the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Near the vale's fresh fountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having past the mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found relief, at play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the first beams of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought to die upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain summits lone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cold and hunger, lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid glaciers, snows, and frost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the sparkling rill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At foot of a small hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shepherdess I met,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see her smiling yet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her cheeks made e'en the red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ripe roses pale; I said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her, 'Good morrow, sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I worship at thy feet!' &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Don Tomas Antonio Sanchez has published the works
of almost all the authors mentioned, with illustrations,
excellent, as well for the notices given of them, as for
the elucidation of the text, which the antiquity and rudeness
of the language, and the errors of manuscripts, by
their complication, obscured. There, as in an armoury,
rest these venerable antiques, precious objects of curiosity
for the learned, of investigation for the grammarian,
of observation for the philosopher and historian,
whilst the poet, without losing time in studying them,
salutes them with respect, as the cradle of his language
and his art.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

OF SPANISH POETRY TO THE TIME OF GARCILASSO.</h3>

<p>Both language and versification present themselves
more fully formed and more vigorous, in the verses
written by the poets of the fifteenth century; and this
progress is matter of no surprise, if we attend to the
multitude of circumstances which at that time concurred
to favour poetry. The floral games, established at
Tolosa in the middle of the former century, and introduced
by the kings of Arragon into their states towards
the conclusion of the same; the concourse of wits who
contended for the prizes proposed at these solemnities;
the ceremonies observed in them; the rank and consideration
given to the art of song; the favour of
princes; a more extended knowledge of ancient books;
the light which now broke forth from all parts, and
dispersed the dark mists of so many barbarous centuries;
a growing acquaintance with Italy, which, with
a happier and more mercurial genius, had been enlightened
before the rest of Europe;&mdash;all contributed
powerfully to the kind reception of this art, the first
that becomes cultivated when nations approach their
civilization. Thus, in casting our eyes upon the ancient
<i>Cancioneros</i> wherein the poetry of this period was collected,
the first thing that surprises us is the multitude
of authors, and the second, their quality. Juan the
Second, who found much pleasure in listening to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
rhymes, and who occasionally rhymed himself, introduced
this taste into his court, and thus all the grandees,
in imitation of him, either protected or cultivated
it. The Constable Don Alvaro made verses; the
Duque de Arjona made verses; the celebrated D.
Enrique de Villena made verses; the Marques de
Santillana made verses; in fact, a hundred others more
or less illustrious than they.</p>

<p>The form which had now been given to versification was
much less imperfect than that of former ages. <i>Coplas
de arte mayor</i> and octosyllabic verses prevailed over
the tedious heaviness of the Alexandrine: their crossed
rhymes struck upon the ear more delightfully, and
stunned it not with the rude and heavy hammered
sounds of the quadruplicate rhyme; whilst the poetic
period, more clear and voluminous, came from time to
time upon the spirit with some pretensions of elegance
and grace. The writers of this period sweetened down
a little the austere aspect which the art had hitherto
presented, and abandoning the lengthy poems, devotional
legends, and wearisome series of dry precepts and
bald sentences, devoted themselves to subjects more
proportioned to their powers, and the murmurs of the
love-song and tone of the elegy were now most commonly
felt upon their lips. Lastly, a more general
reading of the Latin writers taught them sometimes the
mode of imitation, and at others, furnished those allusions,
similes, and ornaments, which served to embellish
their verse.</p>

<p>Amongst the great number of poets which flourished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
then, the one that most excels all others for the talent,
knowledge, and dignity of his writings, is Juan de
Mena. He raised, in his <i>Laberinto</i>, the most interesting
monument of Spanish poetry in that age, and with it
left all cotemporary writers far behind him. The poet
in this work is represented as designing to sing the
vicissitudes of Fortune: whilst he dreads the difficulty
of the attempt, Providence appears to him, introduces
him into the palace of that divinity, and becomes his
guide and tutor. There he beholds, first, the earth, of
which he gives a geographical description, and afterwards
the three grand wheels of Fortune, upon which
revolve the present, past, and future times. Each wheel
is composed of seven circles, allegorical symbols of the
influence which the seven planets have upon the lot of
men, in the inclinations which they give them; and in
each circle are an innumerable multitude of people, who
receive their temper and disposition from the planet to
which the circle belongs; the chaste from the moon,
the warlike from Mars, the wise from the sun, and so
on of the rest. The wheel of time present is in motion,
the other two at rest; whilst that of future time is
covered with a veil, so that although forms and the
images of men are apparent, they are but dimly distinguishable.
The work, conceived upon this plan,
naturally divides itself into seven divisions: and the
poet in describing what he sees, or in conversing with
Providence, paints all the important personages with
whom he was acquainted; recounts their celebrated
actions, assigns their causes, displays great information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in history, mythology, natural, moral, and political
philosophy, and deduces, from time to time, admirable
precepts and maxims for the conduct of life, and the
government of nations. Thus the <i>Laberinto</i>, far from
being a collection of frivolous or insignificant coplas,
where the most we have to look for is artifice of style
and rhyme, must be regarded as the production of a
man learned in all the compass of science which that
epoch permitted, and as the depository of all that was
then known.</p>

<p>If the invention of this picture, which, without doubt,
is the product of a comprehensive and philosophical
mind, had belonged exclusively to our poet, his merit
would be infinitely greater, and we must have conceded
to him, in a plan so noble, the gift of genius. But the
terrible visions of Dante and the <i>Trionfi</i> of Petrarch
being now known in Spain, the force of fancy necessary
to create the plan and argument of the <i>Laberinto</i>, appears
much less; Mena having done nothing more than
imitate these writers, changing the situation of the
scene in which he places his allegorical world. His
sentiments are noble and grand, his views just and
virtuous. We see him take advantage of his subject,
and apostrophize therein the monarch of Castile, reminding
him that his laws should not be like spiders'
webs, but curb alike the strong and the weak: elsewhere
he prays him to repress the horror of a practice
that was then growing common, of poisonings between
the closest connexions; now he is indignant at the
barbarism which had burnt the books of D. Enrique de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Villena;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and now he represents the slaughters and
disorders in Castile, as a punishment for the repose in
which the grandees were leaving the infidels, in order to
attend solely to their own ambition and avarice.</p>

<p>Juan de Mena expresses himself generally with more
fire and energy than delicacy and grace; his course is
unequal; his verses at times are bold and resonant, at
others, they grow weak for want of cadence and metre;
his style, animated, vivid, and natural at times, occasionally
borders on the turgid and the trivial: language,
in fine, in his hands is a slave that he holds but to obey
him, and follow willingly or by compulsion the impulse
which the poet gives it. No one has manifested, in
this way, either greater boldness or loftier pretension;
he suppresses syllables, modifies phrases at his will,
lengthens or contracts words at his pleasure, and when
he does not find in his own language the expressions,
or modes of expression, which he wants, he sets himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to search for them in the Latin, the French, the Italian,
in short, where he can. Spanish idiom not being yet
finished in its formation, gave occasion and opportunity
for these licenses,&mdash;licenses which would have been
converted into privileges of poetic language, if the
talents of this writer had been greater, and his reputation
more permanent. The poets of the following age,
whilst polishing the harshnesses of diction, and making
an innovation in the metres and subjects of their compositions,
did not preserve the noble freedom and acquisitions
which their predecessors had gained in favour
of the tongue. Had they followed their example in
this, the Castilian language, and, above all, the language
of its poetry, so harmonious, so various, so elegant and
majestic, would have had no cause to envy the richness
and flexibility of any other. The <i>Laberinto</i> has met with
the fate of all works which, departing from the common
sphere, form epochs in an art. It has been several times
printed and reprinted: many have imitated it, and
some respectable critics have written commentaries on it,
and, amongst them, Brocensis. Thus it has been transmitted
to us: if it has not been read throughout with
delight, from the rudeness of the language and monotony
of the versification, it has at least been dipped into
with pleasure, occasionally quoted, and always mentioned
with esteem. The author would have conciliated
greater respect, if, when he imposed on himself the task
of writing on the events of the day, he had removed at
a distance from the tumults and intrigues which were
then passing in Castile. This would have been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
way both to see them better, and to judge of them with
greater freedom. Juan de Mena took upon himself a
duty which a courtier could not satisfactorily fulfil; and
his vigorous spirit, employing but half its power in
regard to circumstances, was left far below the dignity
and eminence to which, with greater boldness, it could
easily have attained.</p>

<p>The other most distinguished poets of this century
were the Marques de Santillana, one of the most
generous and valiant knights that adorned it, a learned
man, and an easy and sweet love poet, just and serious
in sentiment; Jorge Manrique, who flourished after,
and who, in his coplas on the death of his father, left
a fragment of poetry, the most regular and purely
written of that time; Garci Sanchez de Badajoz, who
wrote verses with much fire and vivacity; and, lastly,
Mac&iacute;as, anterior to them all, the author of only four
songs, but who will never be forgotten for his amours
and melancholy death.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Whoever looks in the old <i>Cancioneros</i> for a poetry
constantly animated, interesting, and agreeable, will be
disappointed. After perusing one or two pieces,
wherein indulgence towards the writer supplies their
frequent want of merit, the book drops from our hands,
and we have little inclination to stoop to resume it.
It is true that we often meet with an ingenious thought,
an apposite image, and a stanza well constructed; but
it is equally true, that we stumble, at the same instant,
upon ideas puerile, mean, and trivial, upon uncouth
verses, and indeterminate rhymes. The writer is seen
to struggle with the rudeness of the language, as well
as with the heaviness of the versification, and, in spite
of all the efforts he makes, entirely overcome by the
difficulty, he neither strikes out true expression nor
elegant harmony. They knew, and they handled Virgil,
Horace, Ovid, Lucan, and other ancient poets; but if
occasionally they subjected them to their service with
propriety, they more frequently drew from those sources
incoherent allusions, and a learning that degenerated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>into inapposite and puerile pedantry.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> They did not
succeed in imitating either the simplicity of their plans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
or the admirable art with which, in their compositions,
they knew how to unfold a thought with vigour, and to
sustain and graduate the effect from first to last.
Finally,&mdash;their verses, though more tolerable than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
those of a more ancient period, have the great disadvantage
of monotony, and inability to accommodate
themselves to the variety, elevation, and grandeur
which the poetic period ought to possess in correspondence
with the images, affections, and sentiments
it developes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

FROM GARCILASSO TO THE ARGENS&Oacute;LAS.</h3>

<p>To Juan Bosc&aacute;n is generally attributed the introduction
into Spanish poetry of endecasyllables, and
Italian measures. Andreas Navagero, ambassador
of Venice to the court of Spain, recommended to
Bosc&aacute;n this novelty, which, begun by him, and followed
by Garcilasso, Mendoza, Acu&ntilde;a, Cetina, and other fine
spirits, effected an entire change in the art. Not that
endecasyllabic verse was unknown in Castile before.
There are some specimens of it in the <i>Conde Lucan&oacute;r</i>,
written in the fourteenth century; and the Marques de
Santillana in the fifteenth, composed many sonnets in
the mode of the Italians. But these essays had not
obtained consequence, and it was only in the time of
Bosc&aacute;n that the poets generally devoted themselves to
this species of versification. And herein, if rightly I
judge, the intimate relation that now subsisted between
the two nations had more influence than the authority of
a second-rate poet like Bosc&aacute;n; it is, notwithstanding,
without dispute much to his glory to have been the
author of so happy a revolution, and to have contributed
by his example and his talents to its establishment.</p>

<p>But those who were sufficiently satisfied with the old
versification, instantly rose in clamour against the innovation,
and treated its favourers as guilty of treason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
against poetry and their country. At the head of
these, Christoval de Castillejo, in the satires which he
wrote against the <i>Petrarquistas</i> (for so he called them)
compared this novelty to that which Luther was then
introducing in religion, and making Bosc&aacute;n and Garcilasso
appear in the other world before the tribunal of
Juan de Mena, Jorge Manrique, and other troubadours
of earlier time, he puts into their mouth the judgment
and condemnation of the new metres. To this end
he supposes that Bosc&aacute;n repeats a sonnet, and Garcilasso
an octave, before their judges, and presently adds:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Juan de Mena, when he through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had heard the polished stanza new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked most amused, and smiled as though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew this secret long ago;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said: 'I now have heard rehearse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This endecasyllabic verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet can I see no reason why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It should be called a novelty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I, long laid upon the shelf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft used the very same myself.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Don Jorge said: 'I do not see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most remote necessity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dress up what we wish to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a roundabout fine way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our language, every body knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loves a clear brevity, but those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange stanzas show, in its despite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prolixity obscure as night.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cartagena then raised his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From laughing inwardly, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><span class="i0">'As practical for sweet amours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These self-opinioned troubadours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With force of their new-fangled flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not, it strikes me, gain the game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondrously pitiful this measure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is in my eyes,&mdash;a foe to pleasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull to repeat as Luther's creed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most insufferable to read!'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If Juan de Mena and Manrique could then have
manifested any regret, it would have been for not
having had the new versification established when they
wrote. The fiery and daring genius of the one, the
grave and sedate spirit of the other, would have found
for the expression of their thoughts and pictures, a fit
instrument in endecasyllabic verse. They would
instantly have known that the <i>coplas de arte mayor</i>,
reduced to their elements, were one continued and
wearying combination of verses of six syllables; that
the rhymed octosyllabics serve rather for the epigram
and the madrigal than for sublime poetry, and that
<i>coplas de pi&egrave; quebrado</i>,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> essentially opposed to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
harmony and pleasure, ought not to be defended.
This Castillejo could not know; he wrote indeed the
Castilian language with propriety, facility, and purity;
but the inspiration, the invention, sublime and animated
imagery, force of thought, warmth of emotion,
variety, harmony,&mdash;all these qualities, without
which, or without many of which, no one can be considered
a poet&mdash;all were wanting in him. Hence it is
nothing extraordinary, that, entrenched in his coplas,
all sufficient for the acute and ingenious thoughts in
which he abounds, he perceived not the need that
Spanish poetry had for the new versification to issue
from its infancy. The latter had more freedom and
ease, gave opportunity to vary the pauses and cesuras;
and the variety of combinations of which long and
short verses are capable, supplied a flexible instrument
for the various purposes of imitation. Such were the
advantages gained by the new system, and they were
all recognised by the new geniuses who adopted it; but
it was an exact touchstone of the quality of a poet, and
Castillejo, finding it a rigorous one, would not hold
with it. This circumstance was of much more
conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>quence to the dispute than at first sight appears; for
though there had not been the great difference which
there was between the two metres, that party would
have borne away the palm, which could have produced
in its favour the most, and the most agreeable verses
and compositions. In this point of view, the single
talent of Garcilasso should diminish and reduce to
nothing, as he did, all the partisans of the Copla. A
thing truly extraordinary, not to say admirable! A
youth who died at the age of thirty-three, devoted to
the bearing of arms, without any regular studies, with
only his native genius, assisted by application and
good taste, drew Spanish poetry suddenly forth from
its infancy, guided it happily by the footsteps of the
ancients, and of the most celebrated moderns then
known; and coming into rivalry with each in turn,
adorned it with graces and appropriate sentiments,
and taught it to speak a language, pure, harmonious,
sweet, and elegant! His genius, more delicate and
tender than strong and sublime, inclined him by preference
to the sweet images of the country, and to the
native sentiments of the eclogue and elegy. He had a
vivid and pleasing fancy, a mode of thought noble and
decorous, an exquisite sensibility; and this happy
natural disposition, assisted by the study of the
ancients, and intercourse with the Italians, produced
those compositions which, though so few, conciliated
for him instantly an estimation and a respect, which
succeeding ages have not ceased to confirm.</p>

<p>There are some who wish that he had given himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
up more fully to his own ideas and sentiments; that,
studying the ancients with equal devotedness, he had
not allowed himself to be led away so much by the
taste of translating them; that he had not abandoned
the images and emotions which his own fine talent
could suggest, for the images and emotions of others;
that, as for the most part he is a model of purity
and elegance, he had caused some traces which he
keeps of antique rudeness and negligence to disappear;
they wish, lastly, that the disposition of his eclogues
had preserved more unity and connexion between the
persons and the objects introduced in them. But these
defects cannot counterbalance the many beauties
which his poetry contains, and it is a privilege allowed
to all that open a new path, to err without any great
diminution of their glory. Garcilasso is the first that
gave to Spanish poetry wings, gentility, and grace; and
for this was needed, beyond all comparison, more
talent, than to avoid the errors into which his youth,
his course of life, and the imperfection of human
powers, caused him to fall.</p>

<p>To the supreme endowments which he possesses as a
poet, is added that of being the Castilian writer who
managed in those times the language with the most
propriety and success. Many words and phrases of
his cotemporaries have grown old and disappeared: the
language of Garcilasso, on the contrary, if we except
some Italianisms, which his constant intercourse with
that nation caused him to contract, is still alive and
flourishing, and there is scarcely one of his modes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
speech which cannot be appropriately used at the
present day.</p>

<p>So many kinds of merit, united in a single man,
excited the admiration of his age, which instantly gave
him the title of the Prince of Castilian poets&mdash;foreigners
call him the Spanish Petrarch; three celebrated
writers have illustrated and written comments
on him; he has been printed times innumerable, and
all parties and poetical sects have respected him.
His beautiful passages pass from lip to lip with all
who relish tender thoughts and soothing images; and
if not the greatest Castilian poet, he is at least the
most classical, and the one that has conciliated the
most votes and praises, who has maintained this his
reputation the most inviolate, and who will probably
never perish whilst Castilian language and Castilian
poetry endure.</p>

<p>The impulse given by Garcilasso was followed by
the other geniuses of his time; by D. Hernando de
Acu&ntilde;a, Gutierre de Cetina, D. Luis de Haro, D. Diego
de Mendoza, and a few others, but all very unequal to
him: and to meet with a writer in whom the art made
any progress, we must look for him in Fray Luis de
Leon. This most learned man, versed in every kind of
erudition, familiar with the ancient languages, connected
by ties of friendship with all the learned of his
time, was one of those writers to whom the Spanish
language has owed most, for the nerve and propriety
with which he wrote it; and as the one who gave
to its poetry a character hitherto unknown. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
songs and sonnets of Garcilasso were written in the
elegiac and sentimental tone of Petrarch, and his
<i>Flor de Gnido</i> was the only one of his compositions in
which he approaches near to the character of ancient
lyric poetry. Luis de Leon, full of Horace, whom he
was constantly studying, took from him the march, the
enthusiasm, and the fire of the ode; and in a diction
natural and without ornament, he knew how to
assume elevation, force, and majesty. His profession
and his genius inclined him more to the moral lyric
than to the epic, yet his <i>Profec&iacute;a del
Tajo</i><a name="ENanchor_2" id="ENanchor_2"></a><a href="#Endnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> shows what
he could have accomplished in this; in that he has left
some excellent odes, which very nearly approach, if
they do not equal, the models which he proposed to
himself for imitation. His principal merit and character
in them, is that of producing majestic and forcible
thoughts, grand images, and sententious maxims,
without effort, and with the greatest simplicity. His
style and diction are animated, pure, and copious, as
though they gushed from a rich and crystal spring.
He is not so fortunate in his versification; although
sweet, fluent, and graceful, his verse wants stateliness,
and fails not unfrequently from want of harmony and
fulness. With this defect must be named another,
greater yet in my estimation, which is, that no one
shows less poetry when the heat abandons him:
languid then and prosaic, he neither touches, nor
moves, nor elevates; the merit remains alone of his
diction and style, which are always sound and pure,
even when they preserve neither life nor colour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<p>To this same epoch belongs, in my opinion, the
poetry of Francisco de la Torre, published by Quevedo
in 1631. No one doubted then that these were the
works of a poet anterior to the editor; but in these
later days, a gentleman of much merit, D. Luis
Velasquez, reprinted them with a preliminary discourse,
wherein he assures us they were the production of
Quevedo, who wished to publish his amatory verses
under a feigned name. The absolute ignorance
that existed of the quality and particulars of this
Francisco de la Torre; the example of Lope de Vega,
who published, under the name of Burguillos, poetry
known to be his own; the similarity of style which
Velasquez thought he saw between these verses and
those of Quevedo, with other less important reasons,
were the foundation of this opinion, which at that time
was followed without any contradiction.</p>

<p>But these proofs not only pass for mere conjectures,
but being moreover unconfirmed by any positive fact,
vanish the instant we examine the nature and character
of the poetry. He who might not know how to distinguish
the verses of Quevedo from those of Garcilasso,
or any other poet of the former age, could alone
confound Francisco de la Torre with him. Verses
gleaned from the works of both writers, drawn from
their places, and jumbled together, are not proof
sufficient of similarity; nor, even taken in this manner,
will they, if they are well examined, show
the similarity so well as is supposed. To know
if the poetry of Francisco de la Torre be, or be not
that of Quevedo, it is absolutely necessary, after read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>ing
the former, to seek out in the <i>Erato</i> or <i>Euterpe</i> of
the latter, the verses which he there gives for pastoral
poetry: it is then that the vast difference which subsists
between them becomes palpable; whether we examine
the diction, the style, the verses, the images, or nature of
the composition. It is not possible to mistake them,
as it is impossible ever to confound women that are
naturally beautiful with those who torture themselves
to appear so.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, these poems of Francisco de la Torre are the
most exquisite of the fruits which the Parnassus of
Spain had then produced. All of them pastorals, his
images, his thoughts, and his style, detract nothing
from this character, but preserve the most rigorous
keeping with it. His most eminent qualities are simplicity
of expression, the liveliness and tenderness
of his emotions, the luxury and smiling amenity of his
fancy. No Castilian poet has known how to draw
from rural objects so many tender and melancholy
sentiments: a turtle-dove, a hind, an oak thrown
down, a fallen ivy, strike him, agitate him, and excite
his tenderness and enthusiasm. The imitations of the
ancients, in which his poems abound, are recast so
naturally in his character and style, as to be entirely
identified with him. It is a pity that to the purity
of his language was not added greater study of
elegance, which suffers at times from trivial words and
prosaic expressions. At times, also, the diction
becomes obscure from dislocations and omissions of
expression, the results perhaps of negligence, and a
corruption of the manuscript. Lastly, we miss in his
eclogues variety, knowledge of the art of dialogue, and
opposition and contrast in his situations and interlocutors:
the poet who paints and feels with so much
delicacy and fire when he speaks for himself, does not
succeed in making others speak, and loses himself in
uniform and prolix descriptions, which at last weary
and grow tiresome.</p>

<p>Hitherto poetry preserved the natural graces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
simplicity which it had caught from Garcilasso; and
Luis de Leon had succeeded in giving it some sublimity
and grandeur: Francisco de la Torre inclined more to
subjects that require a middle style, such as those which
rural nature presents. He had ornaments of taste, but
without ostentation or wealth, and his language was
more pure and graceful than brilliant and majestic.
The best supporters of this style were Francisco de
Figueroa, who in his eclogue of Tirsi gave the first
example of good blank verse in Spanish; Jorge de
Montemayor, who, with his <i>Diana</i>, introduced the
taste and love of pastoral novels; and Gil Polo, one of
his imitators, who, less happy than he in invention, had
much the advantage of him in versification, and almost
arrived at the point of throwing him into the shade.
But, passing from these writers to the Andalusians<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>,
the art will now be seen to take a change in taste, to
assume a tone more lofty and vehement, to enrich and
adorn the diction, and to manifest the intention of
surprising and ravishing; in short, to aspire to the
<i>mens divinior atque os magna soniturum</i>, by which
Horace characterises true poetry.</p>

<p>At the head of these authors must indisputably
be named Fernando de Herrera, a man to
whom poetic elocution owes more than to any other.
His genius was equal to his industry; and, familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, he devoted himself to
the imitation of the great writers of antiquity, to form a
poetic language which might compete in pomp and
wealth with that which they used in their verses. He
was not, it is true, circumstanced like Juan de Mena;
he had not the license to suppress syllables, syncopate
phrases, or change terminations. This physical part of
the language was now fixed by Garcilasso and his
imitators, and could not suffer alteration. But the
picturesque part might, and in fact, did receive from
him great improvements: he made much use of the
compound epithets that already existed, he introduced
other new ones, he re-established many forgotten adjectives,
to which he imparted new strength and freshness
by the fitness with which he applied them, and used in
fine more phrases and modes of speech distinct from
usual and common language than any other poet. To
this careful attention, he added another quality, not
less essential, that of painting to the ear by means of
imitative harmony, making the sounds bear analogy
with the image. He breaks them; he suspends them;
he drags them wearily along, he precipitates them
at a stroke; he rubs them into roughness, he touches
them into mildness;&mdash;in short, they sometimes roll
fluently and easily along, at others they pierce the ear
with a calm and quiet melody. These effects, which
the verses of Herrera produce by the mechanism of
their language, distinguish them from prose in such a
manner, that though they may be broken up, and lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
their measure and cadence, they still preserve the
picturesque and poetic character which the poet
stamped upon them.</p>

<p>If from the exterior forms we pass to the essential
qualities, it may be said that no one surpasses Herrera
in force and boldness of imagination, very few in
warmth and vivacity of emotion, and none even equal
him, if we except Rioja, in dignity and decorum. The
greater part of his poems consists of elegies, songs,
and sonnets, in the taste of Petrarch. It was Petrarch
who first, deviating from the manner in which the
ancients painted love, gave to this passion a tone more
ideal and sublime. He refined it from the weakness
of the senses, converting it into a species of religion;
and reduced its activity to be constantly admiring and
adoring the perfections of the object beloved, to please
itself with its pains and martyrdom, and to reckon its
sacrifices and privations as so many other pleasures.
Herrera having, throughout his life, a passion for the
Countess of Gelves, gave to his love the heroism of
Platonic affection; and under the titles of Light, Sun,
Star, Eliodora, consecrated to her a passion fiery,
tender, and constant, but accompanied by so much
respect and decorum, that her modesty could not be
alarmed, nor her virtue offended. In all the verses
which he devoted to this lady, there is more veneration
and self-denial, than hope and desire. This
taste has the inconvenience of running into metaphysics
nothing intelligible, into a distillation of pains, griefs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and martyrdoms, very distant from truth and nature,
and which, consequently, neither interests nor affects.
To this error, which may occasionally be remarked in
Herrera, must be added that his diction, too much
studied and refined, offends, almost always, by affectation,
and not seldom by obscurity. The style and
language of love must flow more easy and unencumbered,
to be graceful and delicate. Thus Herrera,
who, no doubt, loved with vehemence and tenderness,
seems, in uttering his sentiments, to be more engaged
about the manner of expressing them, than with the
desire of interesting by them; and to this cause must
be attributed, that, of the Spanish poets, he is the one
whose love-verses are the least calculated to pass from
lip to lip, and from nation to nation.</p>

<p>But the composition in which this rich poetic diction
shines equally with his ardent and vigorous imagination,
is the elevated Ode, which Herrera, a happy imitator of
Greek, Hebrew, and Latin poetry, knew how to fill
with his fire, and thus to become the rival of the
ancients. Lyric poetry, in its origin, was very distant
from the range of ordinary ideas. The poet, possessed
by an afflatus which it was not in his power either to
moderate or to rule, chanted his verses before the altars
of the temples, in the public theatres, at the head of
armies, in grand national solemnities. The genius that
inspired him caused him then to take flight to other
regions, and to see things hidden from the ken of
common mortals. Thence, in a language of fire, and
through all their wonderful circumstances, in grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and forcible addresses to the people, he made Truth
descend from on high, he opened the gates of destiny,
and announced the future; tuned hymns of gratitude
and praise to gods and heroes; or, filling with patriotic
and martial fury armed squadrons, called them on to
battle and to victory. In this situation of things, the
lyric poet should not appear a mortal like the rest of
mankind; his agitation, his language, the numbers to
which he reduced it, the music with which he sang it,
the boldness of his figures, the grandeur of his conceptions,&mdash;all
should concur to the consideration of
him, in these moments of enthusiasm, as a supernatural
being, an interpreter of the Divinity, a sibyl, and a
prophet.</p>

<p>Such, in ancient times, was the character of the ode;
which modern nations have since introduced into their
poetry with more or less success. But, stript of the
accompaniment of song, and removed from solemnities
and numerous assemblages, it has been but a weak
reflection of the first inspiration. The modern poets of
Spain have thought that, to restore it to the exalted
and divine character which it held at its origin, it was
necessary to transplant it again to the regions whence
it sprung, and to fill it with antique ideas, images, and
even phrases. Herrera was the first that thought so.
Horace would have adopted with pleasure his ode to
Don Juan of Austria; his hymn on the battle of Lepanto
breathes throughout the most fervent enthusiasm,
and is adorned with the rich images and daring phrases
that characterise Hebrew poetry; whilst the elegiac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
cancion to King Don Sebastian, animated with the same
spirit as the hymn, but much more beautiful, is full
of the melancholy and agitation which that unhappy
catastrophe should produce on a vivid imagination.
Even in songs, little interesting in their subject and
composition, are found flights daring and worthy of
Pindar. So absolutely superior to all others is his
assiduous attention to diction and the poetry of style,
that never can three of his verses be possibly mistaken
for those of any other poet. The following passage
may serve as a specimen here, extracted from his song
to San Fernando, which is not one of the best.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sacred Betis strewed the wavy shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With purple flowers, fine emeralds, golden ore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tender pearls; toward heaven he raised his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned with grasses, reeds, and corals red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread o'er the sands the moving glass that shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Capricious lustres round his shadowy grot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stretched his humid horns, increasing so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His affluent floods, dilated in their flow;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift roll his billows, murmuring, pure, and cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into ocean far extend his rule."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lope de Vega, quoting these verses as a model of
poetic elevation, so opposite to the extravagances of
<i>Purism</i>,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> exclaimed with enthusiasm, "Here no lan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>guage
exceeds our own; no, not the Greek nor the
Latin. Fernando de Herrera is never out of my sight."</p>

<p>His countrymen gave him the surname of Divine;
and of all the Castilian poets on whom that title has
been bestowed, none deserved it but he. In spite of
this glory, and the praises of Lope, his style and
principles of composition had then but few imitators;
nor, till the re-establishment of good taste in our own
times, has the eminent merit of his poetry, and the
necessity of following his steps to elevate the poetic
above the vulgar language, been properly appreciated.
Don Juan de Arguijo imitated him in his sonnets, a
little curtailing the style of that excessive ornament
which sparkles in Herrera; but the poet who improved
infinitely upon Arguijo was Francisco de Rioja, a
Sevillian like the other two, and a disciple of the same
school, although he flourished several years afterwards.</p>

<p>Equal in talent to Herrera, and superior in taste,
Rioja would, doubtless, have fixed the true limits between
the language of poetry and prose, if he had
written more, or if his compositions had but been preserved.
How is it possible that a man of so great a
genius, and who lived so many years, should have
written no more than one ode, one epistle, thirteen
silvas, and as many sonnets? It is easier to believe
that his writings were lost in the different vicissitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
which his life sustained, or that they lie forgotten with
the many other literary monuments which, in Spain,
wrestle still with dust and worms. The few that he
has left are sufficient, notwithstanding, to give us an
idea of his poetic character, superior to others for nobleness
and chasteness of phrase, for novelty and choice of
subject, for the force and vehemence of his enthusiasm
and fancy, and for the excellency of a style always pure
without affectation, elegant without superfluity, without
tumidity magnificent, and adorned and rich without
ostentation or excess. A merit which particularly distinguishes
him is the happy success with which he
constructs his periods, which neither grow dull from
brevity, nor cumbrous from prolixity; a great and
frequent defect amongst the poets of Spain, whose
sentences, ill distributed, fatigue the voice when recited.
I am well aware that, even in these few compositions,
there are traces of that prosing which marked the poets
of the sixteenth century, and of the tinsel of the
following one; but, besides that these are very rare,
it should be kept in mind that he neither polished nor
arranged his verses for publication; a circumstance
that would sufficiently excuse yet greater errors. But
whatever importance may be attributed to such defects,
none will be able to deprive the delicate Silvas to the
flowers, the magnificent ode on the ruins of Italica, and
the almost perfect moral epistle to Fabio, of the foremost
rank which they enjoy amongst the poetical treasures
of Spain.</p>

<p>To the last third division of the sixteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
belong other poets, celebrated then, but of a merit and
order very inferior to those already named:&mdash;Juan de
la Cueva, who more properly belongs to the history of
comedy, is considered amongst its first corrupters;
Vicente Espinel, to whom music owes the introduction
of the fifth chord in the guitar, and poetry the combination
of rhymes in octosyllabic verses, to which was
then given the name of <i>espinela</i>, but which are now better
known under that of <i>decima</i>; Luis Barahona de Soto,
author of <i>Las Lagrimas de Angelica</i>, a poem very celebrated
then, and read by no one now; Pablo de Cespedes,
sculptor, painter, and poet, in whose didactic poem
on Painting breathes, at times, the vigorous and picturesque
style of Virgil; Pedro de Padilla, whom some
esteemed highly for his pure diction and fluent versification,
but poor of fancy and fire; and lastly, others
less noted, who cultivated the art, and who, if they did
not obtain a great reputation in it, contributed with the
rest to give to verse and style more ease, harmony,
and copiousness.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

FROM THE ARGENS&Oacute;LAS AND OTHER POETS TO GONG&Oacute;RA.</h3>

<p>None of the authors of this time equalled the Argens&oacute;las
in severity of sentiment, facility of rhyme, or
correctness and propriety of language. They are so
paramount in this last quality, that Lope de Vega
says of them, that they came to Castile from Arragon
to teach the Castilian language. Their learning,
the dignity of their maxims, their connexions, and
the great protection extended to them by the Count de
Lemus, were the causes of that kind of sovereignty
which they exercised over their cotemporaries, and of
that authority recognised and confirmed by the praises
that were lavished on them from all quarters. They
have been entitled the Horaces of Spain, and have ever
been regarded as poets of the first rank, preserving a
reputation almost as inviolate as Garcilasso himself.</p>

<p>Without intending to diminish the just esteem which
is their due, or to contend with their many admirers,
we may observe, that their fame appears to us much
greater than their merit; and that if language owes them
much for the exact attention and propriety with which
they wrote it, poetry is indebted to them less, and that
their reputation appears to rest more on their freedom
from the vices, than on any great display of the virtues
of composition. In lyric poetry they are easy, pure, and
ingenious; but generally devoid of enthusiasm, majesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and fancy. As little have they in their love pieces the
grace and tenderness which erotic poetry requires; and if
we except some sonnets of Lupercio, not one of their compositions
in this class can be quoted as deserving to
arrest the attention, or be recommended to the memory
of lovers. I will not speak of the <i>Isabella</i> and the <i>Alexandra</i>,
as it is evident to all, even without the necessity
of a profound acquaintance with the subject, that these
compositions have nothing of the tragedy in them but
the name, and the coolly atrocious deaths with which
they end. Their severe character, the bias of their
disposition, more ingenious and neat than florid and
expansive, the wit and mirth which at times they knew
how to fling forth, were more fit for moral and satiric
poetry, in which they have succeeded best. There are
in them an infinite number of strokes, some valuable for
their depth and boldness, and many for that ingenuity
of thought, that facility and propriety of expression,
which has rendered them proverbial.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<p>These passages, extracted from various satires of
Bartolom&eacute;, and many others of equal or superior merit,
which might be quoted as well from him as from
Lupercio, prove their happy genius for this kind of
poetry. They have been compared to Horace, and
undoubtedly bear most similarity to him, notwithstanding
the preference that Bartolom&eacute; gave to Juvenal.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a>
But at what a distance do they stand from him! The
vivacity, the freedom, the variety, the conciseness, the
exquisite and delicate mixture of praise and censure,
the amiable disdain, and spirit of friendship, which
enchant and despond in that ancient model, are all
wanting in them, and condemn the excessive condescension
or want of taste which led their cotemporaries
to give them the title of Horaces. Facility of
rhyming led them to string tercetos together without
end, in which, if we meet with no unnecessary words,
we find plenty of unnecessary thoughts. This causes
their satires and epistles frequently to appear prolix,
and even at times wearisome. Horace would have
counselled Lupercio to shorten the introduction of his
satire on the Marquesilla, and many of the tales that
occur in it; and Bartolom&eacute; to suppress, in his fable of
the Eagle and Swallow, the long enumeration of birds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
useless and unseasonable for a poet, superficial and
scanty for a naturalist; he would have reminded both,
in short, that strokes of satire, like arrows, should carry
feathers and fly, to wound with certainty and force.
It is painful, on the other hand, to find that they
never leave the tone of ill-temper and suspicion which
they once assume; and that neither indignation
against vice, nor friendship, nor admiration, can draw
from them one warm sentiment or gleam of enthusiasm.
We choose friends amongst the authors we
read, as amongst the men we have to deal with: I
confess that I am not for those poets who, to judge by
their verses, never appear to have loved nor esteemed
any body.</p>

<p>Villegas was a disciple of the younger Argens&oacute;la,
and if to the native talent he had joined some portion
of the judgment and good sense of his master, he would
have left nothing to desire in the department which he
cultivated. He was the first that introduced Anacreontics
in Spanish poetry, and, in spite of their defects,
his Cantilenas and Monostrophes are read with delight,
and remain imprinted on the minds of youth. The
cause of this is, that there is vivacity in them, playfulness,
grace, and cadence, which are the qualities that
characterise this class of compositions, charming alike
the imagination and the ear. His longer verses have not
had equal success, because their ease, their harmony,
and learning, do not compensate for the dissatisfaction
caused by affectation, pedantry, and want of enthusiasm,
for the violent transpositions, vicious modes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
speech, and, lastly, the ringing changes and puerile
antitheses in which they abound.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>He attempted another innovation, which required for
its establishment greater powers than his. He set
himself to compose Castilian sapphics, hexameters,
and distichs; and although the specimens he published
are not altogether unsuccessful, especially the sapphic,
from its analogy to endecasyllabic verse,<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> he has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
no successor in this enterprise. The hexameter demands
a prosody more determinate and fixed than the Spanish
language possesses, to satisfy the ear; and therefore
the imitation of it is so much the more difficult, not to
say impossible. He would, doubtless, however, have
enriched the art by establishing this novelty, had it not
been necessary, for this purpose, that the art were then
in its infancy, in order that the docile and flexible
language might accommodate itself to the will of the
poet, and had he been the colossal genius that could
subjugate others, and dictate to them a law of like
versification. It was an unfortunate time to introduce
fresh measures, when the fine endecasyllabics of Garcilasso,
Leon, and Herrera were known, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
consistency and fixedness of the language and poetry
did not permit them to retrocede to their infancy, which
was absolutely necessary to exercise them in the
man&egrave;ge of Latin versification.</p>

<p>The reputation of this poet did not then correspond
to the proud hopes he cherished when he published
his book. In this, he insulted Cervantes, scoffed at
G&oacute;ngora, jested with Lope de Vega; and, fancying
himself some superior star about to eclipse his cotemporaries,
he represented himself at the head of his
<i>Eroticas</i>, as a rising sun extinguishing the stars with
its rays, and raised the arrogant note,&mdash;<i>Sicut sol
matutinus: me surgente, quid ist&aelig;?</i> Even if he had
united in himself the talents of Horace, Pindar, and
Anacreon, in all their extent and purity, from which he
was yet far distant, this would have been an unpardonable
boast, which not even his youth could excuse.
The public is always greater than any writer, how great
soever he may be; and it is necessary for him to
present himself before it with modesty, unless he wishes
to pass for a madman or a fool. Villegas, after
impertinently irritating his equals, caused no sensation
on the public, but attracted the rude and biting
sarcasms of G&oacute;ngora, and the just and moderate reprehension
of Lope.<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> He was consigned to oblivion till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the appearance of the Parnaso Espa&ntilde;ol, in which collection
he had an eminent place; from that time, he was
again printed, with a prefatory discourse, in which Don
Vincente de los Rios, a man of vast learning and
exquisite taste, but on this occasion too good-natured,
assigned to him the palm of lyric poetry,
which no subsequent critic has confirmed.</p>

<p>The Spanish poets had cultivated up to this time
almost every species of Italian versification. The
harmonious and rounded octave, the exact and laborious
terza, the artificial sonnet, the trifling sextine, the
canzone in its infinite combinations, and blank verse,
although for the most part extremely ill managed<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>&mdash;were
the forms of all their compositions, which came to
be reflections, more or less luminous, of ancient, and of
Tuscan poetry. Some coplas and trobas were made,
though very few, in which the taste prior to Garcilasso
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>prevailed; but when the use of the <i>asonante</i><a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> became
general in the last third division of this sixteenth
century, the taste and inclination for <i>Romances</i> became
equally in vogue, and in them were continued, and, as
it were, perpetuated, the old Castilian poesies.</p>

<p>Utterly stript of the complexity and force, to which
imitation in other kinds of writing obliged them to
have recourse, their authors little caring for a resemblance
with the odes of Horace, or the canzone of
Petrarch, and composing them more happily by instinct
than by art, the <i>Romances</i> could not have the pomp
and loftiness of the odes of Leon, Herrera, and Rioja.
Yet were they peculiarly the lyric poetry of Spain: in
them music employed its accents; they were heard at
night in the halls and gardens to the sound of the
harp or guitar; they served as the vehicle and the
incentive of love, as well as shafts for satire and
revenge; they painted most happily Moorish customs
and pastoral manners, and preserved in the memory of
the vulgar the prowess of the Cid and other champions.
In fine, more flexible than other kinds of composition,
they accommodated themselves to all kinds of subjects,
made use of a language rich and natural, clothed themselves
with a mezzo-tinto soft and sweet, and pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>sented
on every hand that facility and freshness which
rise from originality, and which flow without effort and
without study.</p>

<p>There are in them more fine and energetic expressions,
more delicate and ingenious passages, than in
the whole range of Spanish poetry besides. The
Morisco ballads, in particular, are written with a vigour
and a sprightliness of style that absolutely enchant.
Those customs in which prowess and love are so beautifully
blended, those Moors so gallant and so tender,
that so romantic and delicious country, those names so
sweet and so sonorous, each and all contribute to
give novelty and poetry to the compositions wherein
they are portrayed. The poets afterwards grew
weary of disguising gallantries under the Morisco
dress, and had recourse to the pastoral. Then to
challenges, tournaments, and devices, succeeded green
meads, brooks, flowers, and ciphers carved on trees;
and what the Romances lost in vigour by the change,
they gained in sweetness and simplicity.</p>

<p>The invention in both kinds was beautiful, and it is
wonderful to see with how little effort, and with what
conciseness, they describe the scenery, the hero, and the
feelings that agitate him. Now, it is the alcayde of
Molina, who, entering the town, alarms the Moors by
the report that the Christians are ravaging their fields;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
now, it is the unfortunate Aliatar, borne bloody and
lifeless to his grave in melancholy pomp through the
very gate whence the day before he was seen to issue,
full of gaiety and life: there it is a simple beauty, who
having lost her earrings, the keepsake of her lover, is
in great affliction, dreading the reproaches that await
her; and here it is the solitary and rejected shepherd,
who, indignant at the sight of two turtles billing in a
poplar, scares them away with stones.</p>

<p>The defects of these compositions spring from the
same source as their beauties, or, to speak more correctly,
are the excess or abuse of those very beauties.
Their facility and freedom often degenerated into negligence
and slovenliness, their ingenuity into affectation;
puns, conceits, and false ornaments were introduced
with so much the more liberty, as they more
assisted those flights of gallantry which passed for
refinements of speech, and as they appeared more
excusable in works written merely for self-amusement.
The principal authors of this poetry cannot be
decidedly ascertained; but the golden epoch of the
<i>Romances</i> was before Lope de Vega, Lia&ntilde;o, and a
thousand others, not even remembered, introduced the
bad taste which afterwards corrupted the whole literature
of Spain; it comprises the youth of G&oacute;ngora and
Quevedo, and terminates in the Prince de Esquilache,
the only one after them that succeeded in giving to the
<i>Romances</i> the colouring, grace, and lightness, which
they formerly possessed. But this taste, if on the one
hand it tended to popularize poetry, to give it greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ease and sweetness, and to remove it from the bounds
of imitation, to which former poets had restricted it,
had an equal influence in making it incorrect and
careless, the same facility of composition inviting to
this looseness. Thus it is that the poets who flourished
at the end of the sixteenth, and commencement of the
succeeding century, more harmonious, more easy, more
delightful, and above all, more original than their predecessors,
will be found at the same time more negligent,
and to exhibit less artifice and polish, less purity
and correction in their style and diction.</p>

<p>At this period lived the three poets whose verses
have possessed most amenity, richness, and facility.
The first is Balbuena, born in La Mancha, educated in
Mexico, and author of <i>El Siglo de Oro</i> and of <i>Bernardo</i>.
No one, since Garcilasso, has had such command over
the language, versification, and rhyme; and no one, at
the same time, is more slovenly and unequal. His
poem, like that New World in which the author lived, is
a country spacious and immense, as fruitful as uncultivated,
where briers and thorns are mingled in confusion
with flowers, treasures with scarcity, deserts and
morasses with hills and forests more sublime and
shady. If at times he surprises by the freedom of his
verse, by the novelty and vividness of his expression,
by his great talent for description, in which he knows
no equal, and even occasionally by his boldness and
profundity of thought, he yet more frequently offends
by his unseasonable prodigality, and inconceivable carelessness.
The greatest defect of the <i>Bernardo</i>, is its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
excessive length; it being morally impossible to give
to a work of five thousand octaves the sustained
and continued elegance necessary to give pleasure.
The eclogues of the <i>Siglo de Oro</i> have not the same
defects of composition as the poem, and in the public
estimation enjoy the nearest place to those of Garcilasso.
They undoubtedly deserve it, considering the
propriety of style, the ease of the verse, the suitableness
and freshness of the images, and the simplicity of the
invention. If his shepherds were not at times so rude,
if he had had a more constant eye to elegance in
diction, and beauty in the incidents; if, in short, he had
thrown more variety into his versification, reduced
almost entirely to tercetos,&mdash;there is no doubt but that
good taste would have conceded to him in this branch
of the art an absolute supremacy.</p>

<p>The second of these poets is Jauregui, celebrated for
his translation of the Aminta, a florid poet, an elegant
and harmonious versifier. He is the one who expressed
his thoughts in verse with the most ease and elegance;
but he had little nerve and spirit, and was, besides, poor
of invention. His taste in early life was very pure, as
his <i>Rimas</i> show. But after having been one of the
sharpest assailants of <i>Purism</i>, he ended in suffering
himself to glide with the current, and in his translation
of the Pharsalia, and in his <i>Orpheus</i>, he has abandoned
himself to all the extravagances he had before burlesqued.</p>

<p>But the man who received from nature the most
poetical endowments, and who most abused them, was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
without doubt, Lope de Vega. The gift of writing his
language with purity, elegance, and the deepest clearness;
the gift of inventing, the gift of painting, the gift
of versifying in whatever measure he desired; flexibility
of fancy and talent to accommodate himself to all sorts
of writing, and to all sorts of colouring; a richness
that never knows impediment or dearth; a memory
enriched by a vast range of reading; and an indefatigable
application, which augmented the facility he inherited
from nature: with these arms he presented himself in
the arena, knowing in his bold ambition neither curb nor
limit. From the madrigal to the ode, from the eclogue
to the comedy, from the novel to the epic&mdash;he ran
through all, he cultivated all, and has left in all signs
of devastation and of talent.</p>

<p>He brought the theatre under his subjection, and
fixed upon him universal attention,&mdash;the poets of his
time were nothing compared to him. His name was the
seal of approbation for all; the people followed him in
the streets; strangers sought him out as an extraordinary
object; monarchs arrested their attention
to regard him. He had critics who raised the cry
against his culpable carelessness, enviers who murmured
at him, detractors who calumniated him,&mdash;a
mournful example, in addition to the many other
instances which prove that envy and calumny are
born with merit and celebrity; for neither the amiable
courtesy of the poet, nor the placidity of his genius,
nor the pleasure with which he lent himself to commend
others, could either disarm his slanderers or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
temper their malignity. But none of them could
snatch away the sceptre from his hands, nor abrogate
the consideration which so many and such celebrated
works had acquired for him. His death was mourned
as a public calamity; his funeral drew an universal
attendance. A volume of Spanish poetry was composed
upon his death, another of Italian; and, living and
dying, he was always hearing praises, always gathering
laurels; admired as a prodigy, and proclaimed
"the Ph&oelig;nix of Wits."</p>

<p>What, at the end of two centuries, remains of all
that pomp, of all the loud applauses which then fatigued
the echoes of fame? When we see that, of all the
poetry and poems he composed, there are few, perhaps
none, which can be read through without our being
shocked at every step by their repugnance; when we
see that his most studied and favourite work, the
<i>Jerusalem</i>,<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> is a compound of absurdities, wherein the
little excellence we meet with, makes the abuse of his
talent but the more deplored; when we see that of so
many hundreds of comedies, there is scarcely one
that can be called good; and finally, that of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
thousands of verses which his inexhaustible vein produced,
there are so few that remain engraved on the
tablets of good taste,&mdash;can we do less than exclaim,
where are now the foundations of that edifice of glory
raised in homage of a single man by the age in which
he lived, and which still surprises and excites the envy
of those who contemplate it from afar?</p>

<p>It was not possible for works written with so much
precipitation to have any other result, with his utter
forgetfulness of all rules, and neglect of all great
models; without plan, without preparation, without
study, or attention to nature. The necessity of writing
hastily for the theatre, when he had accustomed the
public to almost daily novelties, unsettled, and, as it
were, relaxed all the springs of his genius, carrying
the same hurry and negligence into all his other
writings.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> Hence it is that, with the exception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
some short poems in which he improved the happy
inspiration of the moment, there are, in all his others,
unpardonable faults of invention, of composition, and of
style. Fatal facility! which corrupted all his excellencies,
which led him to obscure the clearness, the
harmony, the elegance, the freedom, the affluence, and
even the strength with which he was alike gifted;
giving place to unappropriate figures, to historic or
fabulous allusions pedantic and ill-timed; to frigid and
prolix explanations of the very thing he had said
before; to weakness in short, to shallowness, to an insufferable
tone, into which the rich abundance and amiable
purity of his diction and versification degenerated.</p>

<p>The age then, it will be said, was barbarous, that
tolerated such errantries, and that gave so much
applause to a writer so defective. It was not barbarous,
but excessively compliant. There were many
men of talent who deplored this abuse; but they could
not resist the popular approbation which the nature
of Lope's writings carried with it, and which in some
degree his genius authorized. The general sweetness
and fluency of his verse; the lucidness of his
expression, intelligible almost always to the most
illiterate; the fine and polished language of gallantry
which he invented, and brought into use in his
comedies; the decorum and ornament with which he
invested the stage;<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> the vivid and delicate touches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sensibility which he from time to time presents; the
eminent and brilliant parts which the women generally
sustain in his works; in short, his absolute dominion
in the theatre, where acclamations have most solemnity
and force; are all circumstances which concur to excuse
the public of that day, who were not unjust in admiring
most the individual that gave them most delight.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

OF G&Oacute;NGORA, QUEVEDO, AND THEIR IMITATORS.</h3>

<p>To restore to Castilian poetry the tone and vigour which
were failing it, the powers of Horace and Virgil, with all
the grandeur of their genius, the perfection of their taste,
and the high protection they enjoyed, would scarcely
have sufficed. Two men in Spain applied themselves to
this task; both of great talent, but of a depraved taste,
and of different pursuits. Their defects, which they
sometimes relieve by better qualities, had the effect of a
contagion, and produced consequences more fatal than
the evil itself which they sought to remedy.</p>

<p>The first was Don Luis de G&oacute;ngora, the father and
founder of the sect called Purists. All know that after
a century of adoration by the followers of his style,
Luz&aacute;n and the other professors who re-established good
taste, set themselves to destroy the sect by decrying
their founder; and with them G&oacute;ngora and the detestable
poet, were terms synonymous. But this was
unjust; and in him, the brilliant, gay, and pleasant
poet, should ever be distinguished from the extravagant
and capricious innovator. His independent genius was
incapable of following, or of imitating any body; his
imagination, fiery and vivid in the extreme, could not
see things in a common light; and the weak and pallid
colouring of other poets will not bear comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the rich emblazonry, if we may so say, of his style and
expression. In which of them are poetical periods met
with, that in wealth of language, brilliancy, and music,
can be compared with the following?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Deep king of other streams, whose waters go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renowned in song, and crystal in their flow;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Chase the sweet steps of rosy-red Aurora,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loose the reins to Zephyrus and Flora!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In which are images more delicate and appropriate,
or more naturally expressed, than these?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sleep, for your winged Lord in guardianship<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sweet smiling mouth that wooes you to its taste!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'twixt its two red lips armed Love reposes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As a green poplar-leaf in wanton play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dances for joy at rosy break of day.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is not in all Anacreon a thought so graceful as
that of the song, wherein, presenting some flowers to
his lady, he begs from her as many kisses as he had
received stings from the bees that guarded them.</p>

<span class="i0">From thy bosom and mouth they, as flowers, ere death,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be repaid by sweets from the golden comb."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>If from Italian measures we pass to Letrillas and
the Castilian Romance, G&oacute;ngora will be found king
of that class, which has received from no one so much
grace, so many splendours, and so much poetry. His
merit indeed, in this department, is so great, and specimens
of his success in it are so common, that there
remains no other difficulty to prove it than that of
choice. This fragment will suffice for our purpose.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>How could a writer possessing this strength and
richness afterwards abandon himself to the pitiable
frenzies in which he lost himself, without preserving
even a shadow of their excellences! Thinking that the
poetic period was enervated, and looking upon nature
as poverty, purity as subjection, and ease as looseness,
he aspired to extend the limits of the language and
poetry, by the invention of a new dialect which should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
re-elevate the art from the plain, dull track into which,
according to him, it was reduced. This dialect was
distinguished by the novelty of the words, or by their
application; by the singularity and dislocation of the
phrase, or by the boldness and profusion of its figures;
and in it he not only composed his <i>Soledades</i> and
<i>Polifemo</i>, but distorted, after the same manner, almost
all his sonnets and songs, sprinkling as well with a
sufficient number of false ornaments his romances and
letrillas.</p>

<p>If G&oacute;ngora, to the excellent qualities he possessed,
had joined the judgment and good taste he wanted; if
he had made the same profound study of the language
as Herrera, both meditating on the resources which the
idiom presented, and attending to its character, richness,
and harmony, then would have followed the result
he desired, and he would, perhaps, have gained the
glory of being the restorer, and not the opprobrium of
having been the corrupter of the art. But the same
circumstance befel him which befals all who seek to
erect a building without foundations; he gave into a
world of freaks and extravagances, into an abominable
gibberish, as opposite to truth as to beauty, and which,
whilst it was followed by a multitude of the ignorant,
was censured by as many as yet preserved a spark of
sense and judgment.</p>

<p>"He sought," says Lope de Vega, "to enrich the
art, and even the language, with such figures and
ornaments, as were never, till his time, imagined or
beheld. In my opinion, he fully succeeded in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
he aimed at, if this was his aim; the difficulty is in
receiving it. According to many, he has raised the
novelty into a peculiar class of poetry, and they are
not at all mistaken; for, in ancient times, men were
made poets by the study of a whole life; in the
modern, they become poets in a day; as, with a few
transpositions, four precepts, and six Latin words or
emphatic phrases, you will see them elevated where
they neither know nor understand themselves.
Lipsius wrote that new Latin which good judges
in these matters say Cicero and Quintilian laughed
at in the other world. The whole foundation of
the structure is transposition; and what makes it
the more harsh is the so far separating the substantive
from the adjective, where the parenthesis
is impossible: it is a composition full of tropes
and figures; a face coloured in the manner of angels
with the trumpet of judgment, or of the winds in maps.
Sonorous words and figures enamel an oration; but
if the enamel covers all the gold, it is no longer
a grace to the jewelling, but a notable deformity."
And in another part he says, "..., without going
in search of so many metaphors on metaphors,
wasting in rouge what is needed in features, and
enfeebling the spirit with the weight of such an
excessive body. This it is that has destroyed a
great number of talented men in Spain, with such
deplorable effect, that an illustrious poet, who,
writing with his native powers and in his proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
language, was read with general applause, since
he has abandoned himself to purism, has lost it all."</p>

<p>Not satisfied with these demonstrations of severity,
this placid man, who scarcely knew what malignity
was, thought it his duty to persecute the pest as with
fire and sword, and in his comedies, in the burlesque
poetry of Burguillos, in the <i>Laurel de Apollo</i>, and in a
thousand other places, ridiculed and cursed this kind of
poetry, which he characterized as "an odious invention
to make the language barbarous." He was aided in
this warfare by Jauregui, Quevedo, and some others;
but their efforts were unavailing, and they themselves
were at length forced to yield to the contagion. For
though they cannot be called Purists in all the rigour
of the term, they adopted some of the elements which
composed the dialect, such as violent transpositions,
extravagant hyperboles, and incoherent figures. G&oacute;ngora,
meanwhile, as he had never known restraint or
subjection, fulminated against his adversaries the grossest
taunts; and, fierce and proud from the applauses
of the ignorant, internally exulted with all the glory of
a triumph. This was increased by the support given to
his party by the celebrated preacher, Fray Hortensio
Paravicino, from the great influence which he had with
the theologians and sacred orators, and by the unfortunate
Count de Villamediana, in the secret and powerful
favour which he was supposed to have at court.
Both imitated G&oacute;ngora, and drew after them other
writers of less note, propagating thus this barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
language till the middle of the century in which Luz&aacute;n
and other admirable critics entirely succeeded in
weaning the nation from it.</p>

<p>At the same time with the Purists appeared the
<i>Concettisti</i>, punsters, and utterers of grave saws in frigid
and sententious language: D. Francisco de Quevedo
surpassed all, as well by his merit as influence, in the
progress of these different sects. Quevedo, according
to some, is the father of laughter, the treasury of jests,
the fountain of wit, the inventor of a number of happy
words and phrases, in a word, the Comus of Spain.
According to others, he is, on the contrary, a writer
inauspicious to the beauty and decorum of wit: his
humour, say they, instead of being festive, is low buffoonery;
he has impoverished the language, depriving
it of an infinite number of modes of speech, once noble
and becoming, now, thanks to him, low and indecorous;
and if he at any time amuses, it is by the original
extravagance of his follies. These two judgments, so
contradictory, are yet both true; and if we consider
attentively the character of this writer, we shall see
what foundation both the one and the other have for
their censures and applauses. Quevedo was every
thing in excess: no one, in the same manner, displays
in the serious a gravity so rigid and morals so austere;
no one, in the jocose, shows a humour so gay, so free,
and so abandoned to the spirit of the thing. In the
choice of his subjects, we are alike sensible of this
contrariety. Alguazils, scriveners, procuresses, compliant
husbands, ruffians, and women of easy access,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
generally form the subject matter of his buffooneries;
and we must, in justice, acknowledge that he very often
lashes them in a masterly manner. At another time a
theologian and stoic, he translates Epictetus, comments
on Seneca, interprets Scripture, and entangles himself
in the useless labyrinths of metaphysics; lost labours,
which, for the most part, are no longer read, and which
have scarcely any other merit than their astonishing
erudition.</p>

<p>From this contradiction springs so often the effort
and difficulty with which he writes in both kinds of
composition. His style, in prose as in verse, in serious
as in jocose, is always struck forth without connexion
or graduation, sacrificing almost always truth and
nature to exaggeration and hyperbole. His imagination
was most vivid and brilliant, but superficial and
negligent; and the poetic genius that animates him,
sparkles but does not glow, surprises but does not
agitate, bounds with impetuosity and force, but neither
flies nor ever supports itself at the same elevation.
The rage of expressing things with novelty made him
call the brink of the sea <i>the law of the sand</i>; love, <i>the
civil war of the born</i>; trunks of trees on which lovers'
names are engraved, <i>a rural book written in enamel</i>.
In burlesque verse, he heaps together forced allusions,
ambiguities, and paragraphs of nonsense. A ruffian,
to denote how keenly he has felt his disgrace, will say,
that he has wept <i>rope for rope</i>, and not, at every lash;
he will say, that he has had <i>more grasshoppers than the
summer, more tenants than the tomb, more bookstrings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
than the missal</i>. I am well aware that Quevedo often
diverts with what he writes, and raves because it is his
pleasure: I know that puns have their proper place in
such compositions, and that no one has used them
more happily than he. But every thing has its bounds;
and, heaped together with a prodigality like his, instead
of pleasing, they create only weariness.</p>

<p>The same incorrectness and bad taste that mark
his style, composed of words and phrases noble and
sublime, united with others as mean and trivial, are
found in his images and thoughts, which are mixed
together without economy, judgment, or decorum.
The following sonnet will show this miserable confusion
better than any description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Even to the grave that sepulchres the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dies life, and like life, dies, and soon is fled<br /></span>

<p>In spite of these defects, which are certainly very
great, Quevedo will be read with respect, and be justly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
admired in many passages. In the first place, his verse
is for the most part full and sonorous, his rhyme rich
and easy, and yet this merit, the first which a poet
should possess, is not the principal one; our author
knows how to accompany them with many touches,
excellent, some from the brightness of their colouring,
others from their spirit and boldness. His poetry,
strong and nervous, proceeds impetuously to its end;
and if his movements betray too much of the effort,
affectation, and bad taste of the writer, their course
is yet frequently seen to have a wildness, an audacity,
and a singularity, that is surprising. His verses oft-times
spring from his own imagination, and without
extraneous aid strike the ear with their loud and
strong vibration, or sculpture themselves in the mind
by the profundity of the thought they develope, or by
the novelty and strength of the expression. From no
one can such beautiful isolated verses be quoted as from
him; from no one, poetic periods so stately and so
strong.</p>

<p>On meeting in his works with these brilliant passages,
after paying them the high admiration they
deserve, we cannot restrain a feeling of indignation, to
see the deplorable abuse which Quevedo has made of
his talents, in employing on the useless evolutions and
balanced movements of a tumbler, the muscular limbs
and strength of an Alcides.</p>

<p>Don Francisco Manuel Melo was a friend of Quevedo,
a Portuguese, and as indefatigable a writer as he
was an active warrior and politician. He managed
the Castilian idiom with equal facility as his own, and
poet, historian, moralist, author political, military, and
even religious, he excels in some of these departments,
and is contemptible in none. The volume of his verses
is extremely rare, and though some have made him
the imitator of G&oacute;ngora, he has more points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
resemblance to Quevedo; the same taste in versification,
the same austerity of principles, the same affectation
of sententiousness, the same copiousness of
doctrine. He has besides conformed to the example
of Quevedo in publishing his poems, in divisions of the
nine Muses, though three of them are in Portuguese.
There are in the Spaniard colours more brilliant, and
strokes more strong; in Melo more sobriety and fewer
extravagances. His style, though elegant and pure, is
barely poetical; and his amatory verses are deficient in
tenderness and fire, as are his odes in enthusiasm and
loftiness. He is as little happy in the many burlesque
verses with which the large volume of his poetry
abounds; but when the subject is grave and serious,
then his philosophy and doctrine sustain him, and his
expression equals his ideas. Naturally inclined to
maxims and reflections, he was most at home in moral
poetry; in the epistle particularly, where strength and
severity of thought best combine with a tempered and
less profound fancy. Here, if he is not always a great
painter, he is at least chaste and severe in style and
language, in his verse sonorous, grave and elevated in
his thoughts, a respectable moralist in character and
principles. Notwithstanding these distinctions, the
claims of his glory as a writer are more firmly grounded
on his prose works; on the <i>Eco politico</i> for instance, on
his <i>Aula militar</i>, and, above all, on the <i>Historia de las
alteraciones de Catalu&ntilde;a</i>, the most excellent production
of his pen, and perhaps the best work of its kind in
the Castilian language.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>Poetry was meanwhile expiring; tortured by such
demoniacs, it could not recover its beauty and freshness
from the aid of the few who yet composed with
care, and wrote with greater purity. Rebolledo had
neither force nor fancy, and his verses are nothing
more than rhymed prose: Esquilache, with somewhat
more grace in his romances, was spruce and affected,
and had neither the talent nor strength which are
necessary for higher compositions: Ulloa wrote nothing
good but his <i>Raquel</i>: and lastly, Solis, who sometimes
shows himself a poet in his comedies, and often
in his history, is a mere rhymester in his lyrics,
which now are read by none. How could these emasculated
writers raise the art from the abyss into which
it had fallen? The thing was impossible. This vicious
taste was reduced to a system in the extravagant and
singular work of Gracian, <i>Agudeza y Arte de Ingenio</i>,
which is an art of writing in prose and verse, founded
on the most absurd principles, and supported by good
and bad specimens, jumbled together in the most
discordant manner. This Gracian is the same that
composed a descriptive poem on the seasons, under the
title of <i>Silvas del A&ntilde;o</i>; the first I fancy that was
written in Europe on this subject, and most assuredly
the worst. As a specimen of his manner, and
of the laughable degradation to which poetry had
fallen, the following verses will suffice, selected from
the opening of Summer:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"After, in the celestial theatre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horseman of the day is seen to spur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the refulgent Bull, in his brave hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaking for darts his rays of burning gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous spectacle of stars&mdash;a crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lovely dames, his tricks applaud aloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, to enjoy the splendour of the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remain on heaven's high balcony of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in strange metamorphosis, with spurs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crest of fire, red-throated Ph&oelig;bus stirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a proud cock amongst the hens divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hatched out of Leda's egg, the Twins that shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hens of the heavenly field."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is beyond every thing: the whole poem is
written in the same barbarous and ridiculous manner,
and it is a proof as evident as mournful, that there now
remained no memory of the principles of composition,
no vestiges of eloquence. Ornaments, suited to the
madrigal and epigram, were transferred to the higher
kinds of composition, and the whole was changed into
concetti, conundrums, puns, and antitheses. Thus
Castilian poesy came to an end! In her more tender
youth, the simple flowers of the field which Garcilasso
gathered sufficed to adorn her; in the fine writings
of Herrera and Rioja, she presents herself with the
pomp of a beautiful lady, richly attired; in Balbuena,
Jauregui, and Lope de Vega, although too free and
gay, she yet preserved traits of elegance and beauty;
but first spoiled by the contortions taught her by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>G&oacute;ngora and Quevedo, she afterwards gave herself
up to a crowd of Vandals, who completed her ruin.
Thenceforward her movements became convulsions,
her colours paint, her jewels tinsel, and old and
decrepid, there was nothing more for her to do than
madly to act the girl, to wither, and to perish.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS; RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF GOOD TASTE.</h3>

<p>If in this state a glance is cast at the steps which
the art in little more than a century of its existence
had taken, it will be seen that nothing had been left
unattempted. There were translations of all, or of the
greater number, of the ancient authors: epics of all
kinds had been written; the theatre had taken a compass,
and presented a fruitfulness so great as to have
communicated of its wealth to foreigners; lastly, the
ode in all its forms, the eclogue, the epistle, the satire,
descriptive poetry, the madrigal, and epigram, all had
been noticed, and all cultivated.</p>

<p>If this compass and variety do honour to its flexibility
and boldness, the success of its accomplishments
in all these various kinds of composition is not equal.
For, in the first place, the translations are almost all
bad or indifferent. Who, in good truth, can say that
that of the Odyssey, by Gonzalo Perez; of the Eneid,
by Hernandez de Velasco; or of the Metamorphoses,
by Sigler, are real substitutes for the originals? What
person, possessing the least taste in poetic language
and versification, can read two pages of these versions,
wherein the greatest poets of antiquity are metamorphosed
into trivial rhymers, without elegance and
harmony? Spain has a number of epic poems; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
although some fragments of good poetry may be culled
from them, not one can be looked upon as a well-arranged
fable, or as corresponding in dignity and
interest with its title and argument. Of Spanish comedies,
it is notorious that the defects exceed the beauties.
Happier in shorter kinds of composition, her odes,
elegies, sonnets, romances, and letrillas, approach
nearer to perfection. But even in these, what forgetfulness
of propriety, what negligence at times, and
at times what pedantry and false taste exist! In
the best writers, in the choicest pieces, the mind is
offended by finding too frequently joined to a fine turn
a harsh extravagance, and a sharp thorn to an incomparable
flower.</p>

<p>There is one thing extraordinary in the good poets
of the sixteenth century, that their genius never rises
to the level of the events which passed around them.
The compositions of Virgil and of Horace in Rome
correspond with the dignity and majesty of the empire.
Lucan afterwards, though very distant from the perfection
of his predecessors, preserved in his poem the
bold and fiery tone adapted to the subject on which he
wrote, and to the patriotic enthusiasm with which he
was animated. Dante, in his extraordinary poem,
shows himself inspired by all the sentiments which the
rancour of faction, civil dissension, and the effervescence
of men's minds, stirred up. Petrarch, if in his
love-sonnets he sacrificed to the gallantry of his time,
rises, in his Trionfi, to a level with the elevation to
which the human mind was rising at that period. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
was not so with the poets of Spain. The Moors expelled
from the peninsula; a discovered world opening
a new hemisphere to Spanish fortune; fleets sailing
from one extremity of the ocean to the other, accompanied
by terror, and exchanging the riches of the east
and west; the church torn by the reformation of
Luther; France, Holland, Germany, convulsed and
desolated by civil wars and religious dissensions; the
Ottoman power rolled away on the waters of Lepanto;
Portugal falling in Africa, to be then united to Castile;
the Spanish sword agitating the whole world with the
spirit of heroism, of religion, of ambition, and of avarice;&mdash;when
was there ever a time more full of astonishing
events, or more suited to sublime the fancy? Yet the
Castilian muses, deaf and indifferent to this universal
agitation, could scarcely inspire their favourites with
aught but moralities, rural images, gallantry, and
love.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>This deficiency of grandeur is compensated in
part by a moral quality which distinguishes those
poets, and recommends them infinitely. Neither in
Garcilasso, nor in Luis de Leon, nor in Francisco de
la Torre, nor in Herrera, are to be found any traces of
rancour and literary envy, of gross indecency, or of servile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and shameless adulation. The praises which they sometimes
pay to power are restricted within those bounds of
moderation and decorum which make them endurable.
Till the corruption of literary taste, there was no appearance
of this moral degradation, made up of meanness
towards superiors, of insolence towards equals, and of
utter forgetfulness of all respect towards the public;
vices unfortunately sufficiently contagious, and which
defame and destroy the nobleness of an art, that from
the nature of its object, and the means it uses, has in it
something superhuman.</p>

<p>There cannot be denied to a great number of the
Spanish poets admirable talent, extensive learning, and
great acquaintance with the ancient classics, although
it is an uncommon thing to meet in them the sustained
elegance and perfection of taste which other modern
authors have drawn from the same fountains. Many
causes contributed to this. One is, that these
poets communicated little with each other: there
wanted a common centre of urbanity and taste, a
literary legislature, that should draw the line between
bombast and sublimity, exaggeration and vigour, affectation
and elegance. The universities, where dwelt the
greatest knowledge, could not become such, from the
nature of their studies, more scholastic than classical.
The court, where the tone of society and fashion is
most quickly perfected, would have been more to the
purpose; but wandering under Charles the Fifth, severe
and melancholy under the Second Philip, it gave not
till Philip the Third to poetical talent the encourage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>ment
necessary for its perfection; even then, but much
more in the time of his successor, taste was vitiated,
and the encouragement given by princes and grandees,
and even the occasional share they took themselves in
poetical pursuits, could do nothing but authorize the
corruption. In short, there wanted in Spain a court
like that of Augustus, of Leo the Tenth, of the dukes
of Ferrara, and of Louis the Fourteenth; where polite
and refined conversation, devotion to the Muses, culture
and elegance, with other fortunate circumstances,
powerfully contributed to the perfection of the great
writers that flourished therein.</p>

<p>Another cause is the secondary place which poetry
held with many of those who cultivated it. They
wrote verses to unbend themselves from other more
serious occupations; and he who writes verses to amuse
himself, is not usually very nice in the choice of his
subject, nor very careful in its execution. Fatal lot to
Spain in the finest and most difficult of all arts! Poetry,
which is a recreation and amusement for those who
enjoy it, should be a very serious and almost exclusive
occupation with those who profess it, if they aspire to
hold any distinguished rank in reputation. When it is
considered that Homer, Sophocles, Virgil, Horace,
Tasso, Ariosto, Pope, Racine, and others, were at once
the greatest poets and the most laborious, it should not
be thought extraordinary that those have remained so
far behind, who, even supposing them to have possessed
equal talent, equalled them neither in application nor
perseverance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>To this evil was added another and a worse, arising
in a great measure from the same cause. Very few of
the good poets of Spain published their works in their
lifetime. The works of Garcilasso, Luis de Leon,
Francisco de la Torre, Herrera, the Argens&oacute;las, Quevedo,
and others, were published after their death by
their heirs or friends, with more or less judgment.
How much would they not have rejected, if they had
published their writings in their own name! how many
corrections would they not have made in the selection,
and how many spots of slovenliness, bad taste, and
obscurity, would they not have expunged!</p>

<p>But even though the want of perfection from this
cause should seem less imputable to them, it is not on
that account less certain. It has given cause to a
diversity of opinion on the merit of the ancient poets of
Spain, whom some value as admirable models, whilst
others depreciate them so far as to think them unworthy
of being read. In this, as in all cases, partiality and
prejudice are wont to carry critics to their conclusions
more than truth and justice; and to exalt or depress the
dead is often with them nothing but an indirect
mode of exalting or depressing the living. But setting
this consideration aside, it may be said that this vast
difference arises from the different points of view which
are taken for the comparison. Comparing Leon, Garcilasso,
Herrera, Rioja, and a few others, with the
monstrous extravagances introduced and sanctioned by
G&oacute;ngora and Quevedo, there is no doubt that the
former should be regarded as classical writers, perfect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and worthy to be imitated and followed: if compared
even with the great authors of antiquity, or with the few
moderns that have approached near, or have excelled
them, we have yet to discover the reason why many treat
them with such excessive rigour. As to myself, without
pretending to lay down for a rule my particular opinion,
and judging by the effect produced on me in the
perusal, I would say, that though I consider the ancient
Spanish poesies as sufficiently distant from perfection,
they yet convey to my mind and ear sufficient pleasure
for me to overlook in their graces the negligences and
blemishes I meet with. I would, moreover, be bold to
say, that if the poets of Spain had cultivated the loftier
kinds of poetry, the epopee and the drama, with the
same successful diligence as the ode and other shorter
species, Spain would have been satisfied with the praises
that would have fallen to her lot in this delightful
department of literature. I will add, lastly, that, in my
judgment, it is absolutely necessary to read and study
these poets, in order to learn the purity, propriety, and
genius of the language, to form the taste and ear to the
harmony and flow of its verse, and to acquire the structure
of the true poetic period. It would not be difficult,
nor perhaps foreign to my subject, to show in her
modern compositions the influence which exclusive
admiration or exaggerated depreciation of the fathers
of Spanish poetry has had upon her authors; but this
application, necessarily odious, enters neither into my
character nor design.</p>

<p>Castilian poetry, buried in the ruins wherein sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the other arts, sciences, and power in the time of
Charles the Second, began to be revived towards the
middle of the last century, by the laudable efforts of
some literary characters who devoted themselves
wholly to the re-establishment of classical study.
The principal glory of this happy revolution is due to
D. Ignacio de Luz&aacute;n, who, not satisfied with pointing
out the path of good taste in his <i>Poetica</i>, published in
1737, gave no less the example of treading in it, by the
poetical beauties which are visible in the few compositions
of his that have been published. His poetry, like
that of all professed critics, is recommended more by
its dignity, circumspection, and propriety, than by any
sublimity or boldness; but his memory will be always
respected as that of the restorer of Spanish poesy.
Others followed in the same career: the Count of
Torrepalma, whose <i>Deucalion</i>, notwithstanding some
touches of bombast and purism which it preserves,
is one of the strongest and best pieces of descriptive
poetry in Castilian; D. Josef Porcel, author of some
hunting eclogues, much praised by all his cotemporaries,
but which I have not read, nor indeed have
they been collected for publication; D. Augustin
Montiano, a learned man and of good taste, though
deficient in imagination and genius; D. Nicolas de
Moratin, a poet gifted with a lively and flexile fancy,
and an original and forcible expression, who for his whole
life has been struggling with indefatigable zeal in
favour of the principles and rules of correct composition:
and, lastly, Don Josef Cadalso, in whose hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the Anacreontic, which had been buried with Villegas,
revived towards the end of the century. In this gay and
agreeable writer terminate the trials and efforts for the
revival of the art. From that period a new epoch in
Castilian poetry commences, upon another foundation,
with another character, with other principles, and it
may even be said, with other models; an epoch, the
description and judgment of which posterity will know
how to give with more justice, authority, and propriety,
than it is generally supposed can be given by

<h2>LIFE OF GARCILASSO.</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the many distinguished men, to whom, in the
enterprising reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain
had the honour of giving birth, there are few
perhaps much more admired by herself, or that
come recommended to the notice of a stranger
with so much interest as Garcilasso de la Vega.
Whether considered as the cultivated spirit, who,
shaking from the Spanish lute the dust of ages,
imparted to it by the force of his genius, a more
harmonious string and a more polished tone; or
whether as a young warrior, brought up in the
court of the most celebrated prince of his age,
qualified both by birth and education to take
part, and actually taking part in that prince's
enterprises, till doomed to fall the victim of his
too rash valour, his story is calculated to strike
forcibly the attention, and to touch the springs
of admiration and of sympathy in no common
degree. The character of the times in which he
lived, of the monarch whom he served, his own
adventures, his deep devotion to the muses during
the few hours of leisure which alone he was able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to snatch from the hurry and alarm of war, the
amiable qualities and classic taste developed in
his writings, and the new impulse which these
writings gave to Spanish poesy,&mdash;all offer to the
biographer a theme more fertile than usually falls
to his lot in recording the lives of poets, and upon
which he would love to bestow the illustration
they deserve. But unfortunately for such a desire,&mdash;a
desire in which every one must participate,
who peruses the fine relics which his fancy has
left of its sweetness,&mdash;the pen of his cotemporaries
was unemployed in the record of his actions, and
centuries were suffered to elapse before any of his
countrymen set themselves to the task. It was
then too late; the anecdotes that marked the
character of the man, and all those slighter traits
which in a more particular manner give life and
individuality to biography, had perished with his
intimate associates; and those who admired his
talents, and desired to illustrate them, were obliged
to gather from his works, and from the common
voice of fame, their scanty particulars, and to
make up the deficiency of incident by excessive
compliments and eulogies. The consequence is,
that although he lived on terms of close intimacy
with many who were admirably qualified to depict
the lights and shadows of his amiable mind and
eventful life, a writer of the present day can hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
alone to offer to the world a bare outline of his
actions, unenriched by any of those distinctive
touches which give value to a portrait. An
industrious research into such of the Spanish
annalists and cotemporary historians as are to be
met with in our public libraries, and the interest
I have naturally taken in his story, have enabled
me to glean several particulars and incidents
unnoticed by any of his commentators; but these
must be still too few to satisfy our common
curiosity, and it must always remain a subject of
regret that we know so little of him, who has
ever been considered by his countrymen as one of
their most elegant writers, as the one in short
who contributed most to the polish and refinement
of their language.</p>

<p>Garcias, or, as he is commonly called, Garcilasso
de la Vega, was born of one of the noblest
titled families in the ancient city of Toledo. His
ancestors from remote antiquity were persons of
opulence and high consideration, as is evident
from the frequent mention of them in the old
chronicles of the kingdom. They originally
sprang from the mountains of Asturias, having
their seat on the banks of the river Vesaya, a
league from Santillana, but making in course of
time Toledo their principal residence. The first
of our poet's ancestors, whom I find chronicled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Spanish story, is Don Diego Gomez, a very rich
and distinguished knight in the reign of Don
Alonzo the Seventh, a prince cotemporary with
our Henry the First. From him sprang Gonzalo
Ruyz, who lived in the time of Don Ferdinand
the Third and Alonzo the Wise. His descendant,
Don Pedro Lasso, was in the year 1329 Admiral of
Castile; his son Garcilasso arrived at yet greater
honours, being the principal favourite of Alonzo
the Eleventh. He was made High Judge and
Superintendent of sheep-walks in Castile, as well
as Chancellor of the kingdom, and was entrusted
with the education of the lady Blanche, daughter
of prince Pedro who had fallen in battle against
the Moors, no less than with the care of her
estate. So rich was he become, that he purchased,
says Mariana, the whole lordship of
Biscay, of the lady Mary, mother of Don John,
who aspiring to the marriage of the infant Blanche,
in order to obtain the great estates whereof she
was the heiress, had been treacherously invited to
a banquet in the palace, and by the king's orders
cruelly put to death. Garcilasso was employed
by the king in several important negotiations, and
amongst others, in that of thwarting the designs
of D. John Manuel, who had renounced his
allegiance to the crown, and was in arms to
revenge the affront put upon him by the king in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
divorcing his daughter to make way for a second
marriage. But in these turbulent times the highest
distinctions of court-favour served only to mark
out those who enjoyed them for destruction, either
by the common vice of courts, intrigue, or by
the more decisive dagger. The nobles of the
kingdom, piqued at the elevation of one who was
no noble to such high offices of trust, or envying
his favour and influence with the king, conspired
together, and he was assassinated in the church
of Soria during the celebration of mass, A.D.
1328. Alonzo was seized with the greatest
concern when the news of the murder was brought
him; nor was his grief overcome, though his
revenge was gratified, by the swift justice executed
on the principal conspirators. The lordship of
Biscay did not long remain in the family of the
purchaser, being at the king's desire restored
to the heiress of the attainted family on her
marriage with Don John de Lara. The murdered
Chancellor left two sons, Garcilasso and
Gonzalo Ruyz, who in the grand battle of
Salado, 1340, were the first that in spite of the
Moors passed the river. The former was made
Lord Chief Justice of Spain, as appears by the
deeds of the year 1372; and this knight it was,
who for his valour in slaying a gigantic Moor
that had defied the Christians by parading in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<i>Vega</i>, or plain of Granada, with the words 'Ave
Maria' fixed to his horse's tail, took the surname
De la Vega, and for his device the Ave Maria in
a field d'or;<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> as is seen in the scutcheon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Garcilasso de la Vega, a son of one of the
brothers, who followed the party of King Henry
against the king Don Pedro, was slain in the
battle of Najara, and lies buried in the royal
monastery of that city, in the chapel de la Cruz,
near Donna Mencia, queen of Portugal. He had
married Donna Mencia de Cisneros, and left a
daughter, Leonora de la Vega, who married Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, High Admiral of
Castile, a knight much celebrated in the annals
of that period for his naval and military actions.
From this marriage sprang D. I&ntilde;igo Lopez de
Mendoza, who in 1445 was created Marques de
Santillana, Gonzalo Ruyz de la Vega, and two
daughters, the elder of whom, Elvira Lasso de
la Vega, marrying Gomez Suarez de Figueroa,
continued the line of descent. Their son, Don
Pedro Suarez, acquired the estate of Los Arcos
and Botova by marriage with the lady Blanche de
Sotomayor, and Don Pedro Lasso was the fruit
of their union. The father of our poet, who was
likewise named Garcilasso, was the fourth lord of
Los Arcos, Grand Commendary of Leon, a knight
of the Order of St. James, and one of the most
distinguished gentlemen in the court of Ferdinand
and Isabella, being appointed Counsellor of State
to their Catholic Majesties, and sent as their
ambassador to Pope Alexander the Sixth;<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> his
wife, Donna Sancha, of the illustrious house of
Toral, was lady of Batres, a considerable domain
in Leon, where a fountain, the same our poet
describes in his second eclogue, is still seen to
play, and bears the name of Garcilasso's fountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
an illustrious monument of the estimation in
which his writings were held.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> According to the
best accounts, Garcilasso, who was destined to
rival, if not eclipse in battle the valorous deed of
the first De la Vega, was born at Toledo, in the
year 1503, a few years only after the birth of the
celebrated Charles the Fifth; and when, on that
prince's accession to the crown, he was persuaded
to visit Spain, in the resort which the nobility
made to him at Barcelona, Garcilasso, then in his
fifteenth year, was not left behind. The office
which his father had held under Ferdinand,
rendered his attendance on such an occasion
indispensable, and Garcilasso was presented to
the prince. With a graceful person, frank
address, and the most amiable dispositions, it
may easily be conceived that he soon recommended
himself to the notice and favour of
Charles. What confirmed these first prepossessions,
was his skill in those martial and gymnastic
exercises, which formed in that age the chief
pride of persons of rank, and to which the prince
always showed an excessive fondness: to ride at
full speed, to leap, to wrestle, to fence, to tilt, to
swim the Tagus&mdash;in these accomplishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Garcilasso, who, as a younger son, was probably
early devoted to the profession of arms, bore the
palm from his competitors, and in these severe
amusements their hours were frequently spent
together. Garcilasso knew, however, and loved
to temper the exercises of the gymnasium with
those more elegant pursuits and studies to which
his royal companion showed but little inclination.
Of music, from his earliest years, he was passionately
fond, and on the harp and the guitar,
already played with extreme sweetness.<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> Music
called into exercise the poetical powers with which
he now began to feel that he was gifted, and
refined both his ear and taste to perceive the wide
distance subsisting between the songs and coplas
of his native poets, and the writings of those
Latin, Greek, and Tuscan masters, to whose
works his studies were directed. His acute
judgment at once perceived the error into which
the generality of Spanish poets had fallen, in
contenting themselves with their merely natural
endowments, without giving attention to art, as
though impatient of the toil of culture. Dissatisfied
with the little they had accomplished, he set
himself sedulously to the study of more classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
models than his countrymen had yet taken as
standards of good writing; and the pure elegance
of the Greeks, and harmonious numbers
of the Tuscans, alternately engrossed his attention.
In these pursuits was associated with him
Juan Almogavar Bosc&aacute;n, a young man of honourable
family, born at Barcelona, with whom he
probably became first acquainted on his visit to
that city with his father; for whom he entertained
through life the warmest affection, and of whose
amiable mind and poetical talent he has left in
his writings many interesting testimonies. They
applied themselves to their purpose with all the
devotedness of youthful enthusiasm, newly conscious
of its latent powers. Dante, Ariosto, and
Petrarch, were ever in their hands, and the reputation
of cotemporary poets amongst the Italians,
of Bernardo Tasso, Tansillo, Sannazaro, and Bembo,
quickened their literary ambition. But the poet
whom above all others Garcilasso evidently
studied with the most partiality, was Virgil. The
mild and tender spirit which pervades and shines
throughout his beautiful writings, was in peculiar
concordance with the disposition and character of
Garcilasso, naturally inclined to the gentle and
the affectionate, to the love of rural images and
the tranquillity of a country life, though drawn by
circumstance into a ruder sphere, and compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
by passing events so frequently to cast aside the
pages of the poet and the tones of the lyre, for
the sword of battle and those military exertions
which his country shortly claimed of him.</p>

<p>Although the nobility and nation at large had
hailed Charles's arrival with delight, it was not
long before they began to regard his proceedings
with extreme mistrust and jealousy. For this
there were many causes; but that which excited
the greatest discontent was his almost exclusive
partiality for his Flemish favourites, and the
ascendancy of a Flemish minister. The great
Ximenes, whose commanding genius had secured
from a murmuring nobility the peaceful recognition
of his title, was gone; weighed down by years,
and by mortification at being refused an interview
by the king, in which his prophetic spirit hoped
to expose the calamities impending over the
country from the insolence and rapacity of
foreign minions, he expired. His death freed
Chievres from those fears with which he could
not but regard his superior talents, and for
awhile he ran his round of misgovernment
without restraint. He engrossed, or exposed to
sale all offices and appointments, exported into
Flanders all the treasures he could amass in the
collection of the taxes, imposed new ones, and
sedulously guarded the king's ear from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
language of complaint. But this system of arbitrary
peculation could not long escape the indignant
remonstrances of a high-spirited and free
people. Already Toledo, Segovia, Seville, and
several other cities of the first rank, had entered
into a confederacy for the defence of their rights
and privileges, had laid before the king complaints
of the mal-administration under which
they suffered; and the first rumour of his intended
departure for Germany to receive the imperial crown
of Maximilian, was a signal for every hitherto
suppressed discontent to burst forth in open violence.
The nobles of Valencia refused to admit
the Cardinal, afterwards Pope Adrian, as the royal
representative, and firmly declared, that by the
fundamental laws of the country, they could grant
no subsidy to an absent sovereign: exasperated
by their obstinacy, Charles countenanced the
people who had risen against their privileges; he
rashly authorized them to continue in arms, and
sanctioned the association into which they
entered under the fatal name of the Germanada
or Brotherhood.</p>

<p>The civil dissensions which followed in the
king's absence, the alliance of the commons in
the principal cities, under the title of the Junta,
the actions and death of their heroic leader John
de Padilla, and the final extinction of the Ger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>manada, are
historical events generally known.
Less generally known, however, is the honourable
and distinguished part which Don Pedro, the
elder brother of Garcilasso, took in these commotions,
and we may with little impropriety devote a
few pages to its consideration. Our English
historians, seizing upon the leading features of
the struggle, have celebrated alone the proceedings
of Padilla, whose deeds in arms and tragical
end seemed to mark him out as the principal
personage of the drama. They have not communicated
the fact, that Don Pedro Lasso
was thought by the Junta to be more worthy of
the distinction of Captain-General, was indeed
elected such, and that it was only by low intrigues
with the meanest of the people that Padilla had
the election reversed in his favour.<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> Young,
generous, brave, of an open and sweet disposition,
and intolerant of every species of injustice and
oppression, Don Pedro Lasso pursued the views
he meditated for the freedom and welfare of his
country, with a simple sincerity and straight-forwardness
of action, which showed clearly that
he was swayed by no personal motives of aggrandizement
or popularity; he dared the frowns of
his sovereign, without stooping to pay court to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the passions of the people. Equally brave and
zealous, but with views less purely patriotic, and
an ambition more daring, John de Padilla threw
himself into their ranks, and sealed his devotion
to the cause he embraced, by a death which he
met with the utmost fortitude and boldness. But
if the springs of his conduct are closely examined,
they will furnish us with but too certain grounds
for belief, that his own aggrandizement in the
minds of men occupied quite as much of his
thoughts as the good of his country; and if any
mode seemed likely to facilitate his ends, he did
not stand upon niceties in the use of them. Don
Pedro, when he saw the unconstitutional excesses
into which the Germanada were hurrying, laboured
to lead them back by ways that would have
secured from the monarch a recognition of the
rights and claims for which they fought: with a
blinder or less disinterested policy, Padilla led
them on to fresh enterprises, which extinguished
the high hopes in which the people indulged.
Had the series of events led Don Pedro to the
scaffold, he would have met his doom with calm
and unpretending dignity, sufficiently rewarded
by the testimony of a good conscience; Padilla
bent his thoughts to the last to stand high in the
applause of men, and the address to the citizens
of Toledo, which he caused to be circulated at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
death, noble and fine-spirited as it was, betrayed
not merely a satisfaction with being, but a thirst
to be considered the martyr in their cause he was.</p>

<p>So soon as it was known that the king intended
to leave Spain, and that the calling of the Cortes
together would only increase their taxes, the
principal cities sent either petitions or protests
against what they deemed so mischievous a measure.
The citizens of Toledo, who considered
themselves, on account of the great privileges
they enjoyed, as guardians of the liberties of the
Castilian commons, and were especially discontented,
took the lead; they wrote to the other
cities of Castile, exhorting them to send messengers
to the king for the redress of their grievances:
all, except Seville, returned for answer,
that the representatives whom they sent to the
approaching Cortes should act conformably to
their desire. The persons who interested themselves
most in this affair were Don Pedro, Padilla,
and Fernando de Avalos, a gentleman of high
extraction, and allied to the first nobles of Spain,
all commissioners of the juntas in the city. They
perpetually urged the expediency of a general
assembly being held of those states that sent votes
to the Cortes, to petition for a reformation of the
abuses of government; it was at length debated
in junta, but met with much opposition from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
king's party; the dispute waxed hot, insomuch
that Padilla and Antonio Alvarez de Toledo drew
their daggers at each other. After some disturbances
in the city, it was at last voted that
they should send two of their regidores as Procuradores,
and two Hurados to the king to
demand redress: Don Pedro and Alonzo Suarez
were appointed Procuradores, and departed with
their equipages for Valladolid. They came into
the palace as the king, with his dukes, bishops,
and ministers of state, were rising from dinner,
and requested audience; he, being already acquainted,
through Alvarez de Toledo, with the
nature of their embassy, pleaded haste, and was
retiring; but Don Pedro pressed so urgently the
importance of the business they were charged
with, that he was obliged to appoint them to meet
him at Benavente, on his way to St. Jago, where
he had appointed the Cortes to be held, and meanwhile
referred their petition to his Council of
Justice. It will readily be imagined that no very
favourable reception was given by the Council to
a petition complaining, not merely of the monarch's
leaving the kingdom, but of his ministers' lavishing
all offices on strangers, and their rapacity in
engrossing the treasures of Spain to enrich a
foreign nation. The Council gave their judgment
to the king, that the framers and supporters of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
petition so dangerous deserved punishment rather
than satisfaction; upon which he sent for the
Procuradores to his chamber, and with a severe
frown told them he was not pleased with their
proceedings, and that if he did not consider from
what parents they were descended, he would
punish them as they deserved; then, referring
them to the President of his Council, without
listening to their excuses, he retired. The President
desired them to return and prevail with
their city to send commissioners to the approaching
Cortes, who might present a memorial of
what they desired, which should be disposed of
as might best suit the general good: they refused
compliance, and followed the king to St. Jago.</p>

<p>The Cortes was convoked: Charles opened it
in person, and stating the circumstances that
rendered it necessary for him to leave the kingdom,
requested the usual subsidy, that he might
appear in Germany with the splendour suitable to
his dignity. The Commissioners of Salamanca
refused to take the oath, unless he would first
grant them what they desired: for this act of
court-disrespect they were forbidden to come
any more into the assembly. Then rose Don
Pedro: he said he had brought a memorial from
the city of Toledo, of what he was to do and grant
in Cortes, which his majesty might see; that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
could not go beyond his commission, yet would
perform it as should be most agreeable to his
sovereign; "but, my Lord and Se&ntilde;ors," said he
with a generous enthusiasm, "I will sooner
choose to be cut in pieces, I will sooner submit
to lose my head, than give my consent to a
measure so mischievous as this which is contemplated,
and so prejudicial to my city and my
country." This bold speech, coming upon an
assembly already sufficiently indignant at the innovation
of transferring the Cortes to so remote a
province, and at the demand for a new subsidy
before the time for paying the former one was
expired, operated most powerfully: the commissioners
of Seville, Cordoba, Salamanca, Toro,
Zamora, and Avila, supported Don Pedro's remonstrance,
refused their assent, and the king,
perceiving the present temper of the assembly,
adjourned it to a more convenient season.</p>

<p>The Council meanwhile were not inactive; they
thought it would be well, on their part, to send
some of the chief officers in opposition back to their
cities, that their places might be supplied by
others that would be more pliant to the wishes
of the king. This was accordingly done, and
other regidores were commanded under heavy
penalties to attend the court, that Toledo might
revoke the powers given to Don Pedro and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
colleague: John de Padilla was one of the persons
cited. But, with one exception, these regidores
excused themselves; and the delegates from
Toledo and Salamanca made a request to the
others, that as their Commissioners were not
yet come to the Cortes, or not admitted,
nothing should be granted,&mdash;protesting that if
any vote of money were passed, it should not be
to the prejudice of their cities. This protest was
sent in to the new Assembly; but, though many
voted in its favour, they would neither receive it,
nor suffer the delegates from Toledo to enter.
Whereupon they made their protest at the door, declaring,
that as they could not form a Cortes without
their commissioners, the acts they might pass
should be null and void, both as respected their
cities and the kingdom at large; requiring them
moreover as citizens, not to assemble as a Cortes
till they could do so constitutionally. Charles,
hearing that Don Pedro and his companions
slighted his commands, issued on Palm Sunday
immediate orders for their banishment. Don
Pedro was ordered within forty days to go and
reside in the government of the fort of Gibraltar,
which was his own inheritance; and not to depart
from thence without the king's permission, under
penalty of losing, not only that command, but all
his estates whatsoever: but they, ill brooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
such rigorous and arbitrary measures, went within
two hours of night to the palace, and strongly
remonstrated with the minister; the result was
an agreement for them to retire only a few miles
from St. Jago, leaving the Hurado Ortiz behind,
to remind Chievres to solicit the revocation of
their sentence of banishment; but no sooner had
they followed this crafty advice, and left the
town, than the treacherous Fleming opposed it in
Council, and no relaxation could be obtained.</p>

<p>Toledo heard of the banishment of their messengers
and failure of their embassy, and were
exasperated beyond measure. Of this spirit of
discontent, John de Padilla took all possible
advantage. "Seeing," says the Spanish historian,<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a>
"things go forward as they wished, he
and Avalos, the other summoned regidor, made a
show of complying with the king's command.
Hereupon the armed populace, to the number of
six thousand men, withstood their apparent intention,
and a great tumult was raised, Padilla all
the while desiring them to let him fulfil the
king's command, which renewed the people's resolve
to detain them; and the crowd led them away
as honourable prisoners, set a guard over them,
still protesting against, though inly rejoiced at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the violence, and obliged the governor, at the
sword's point, to forbid them on their oath from
leaving the city." Not satisfied with this, they
seized the bridges and fortified gates, and attacked
the alcazar, or castle, which they soon obliged
the governor to surrender. Emboldened by this
success, they deprived of all authority every one
whom they suspected of being in any wise attached
to the court, established a popular form of internal
government, and levied troops in their defence.
Thus, by the evil counsels of an arrogant ministry,
was kindled the first spark of that rebellious
flame which afterwards burned in men's bosoms
with so much fury, and involved the whole kingdom
in civil discord; another instance to the
many others which history furnishes,&mdash;if warning
were of any avail,&mdash;of the terrible consequences
arising from an administration's slighting the
voice of an aggrieved and proud-spirited people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Don Pedro and his companions were
come again to St. Jago; and though some gentlemen,
their friends, had counselled them to be
gone, lest the king, already sufficiently incensed
against the Toledans, should imagine them to
have abetted the commotion in their city, and
punish them accordingly, they yet continued
there, without much fearing what might befal
them. But Garcilasso, who in this crisis could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
not avoid feeling a brother's anxiety and alarm,
earnestly desired the king's solicitor to go with
all expedition to St. Jago, and persuade him to
depart, as now only five days remained of the
forty limited for his retirement. The solicitor
took post, communicated the entreaties of Garcilasso,
and with added arguments at length prevailed.
Passing through Zamora, Don Pedro
arrived by the expiration of the fifth day at
Cueva, a village of his, on his way to Gibraltar.
The Toledans, hearing of his arrival there, sent
messengers to request him to return to the city;
but this he refused, and prepared to prosecute his
journey. Upon this, they ordered a party of
horse to intercept and bring him thither, which he
was forced to attend, and got as privately as he
could to his own home: he could not, however,
keep himself long retired; the people in immense
numbers flocked round his house, obliged him to
come forth, set him on horseback, then, forming a
triumphal procession, escorted him to the church,
and with loud acclamations of joy extolling to the
skies his patriotism, his courage, the resolution he
had shown in defence of their liberties, saluted
him with the title of the Deliverer of his Country.<a name="FNanchor_AA_27" id="FNanchor_AA_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a></p>

<p>If the history of these events were followed up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Don Pedro would be found acting uniformly the
same part of a pure and fearless patriot. He it
was who when the nobles, jealous of the rising
freedom of the commons, opposed in arms its
progress, was principally instrumental in prevailing
on Queen Joanna to come from her retirement,
and to use in this state of civil disorder
the constitutional authority with which she had
been invested on the accession of Charles. Upon
him was conferred, after the rash indiscretion of
Don Pedro Giron, the office of Captain-General,
which Padilla by his artifices caused to be
revoked in his own favour: it was no personal
offence however that could cool his ardour in
the cause of freedom and his country; he led the
vanguard of cuirassiers in the battle with the
royalists which terminated in the defeat near
Tordesillas. It was not till he saw the Junta bent
upon pushing their demands and measures to an
excess which threatened the extinction of the
rights and privileges of the nobility, that he
ceased taking an active part in their proceedings;
but even then he exerted his good offices in the
negotiations carried on between them, and would
have persuaded the people to accept the terms
offered by the nobility, who, on condition of the
Junta's conceding a few articles subversive of
the royal authority and their own unalienable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
privileges, engaged to procure the Emperor's consent
to their other demands, and to join with
them in order to extort it, if the influence of
evil counsellors should lead to a refusal. Unfortunately
for the liberties of Spain, the Junta,
elevated by success or blinded by resentment,
refused assent to any such reasonable conditions;
the army of Padilla was shortly after defeated by
the Count de Haro, the royalist general; Padilla
himself, disappointed of the death he sought on
the lost field, was taken and executed; and this
bold attempt of the commons did but contribute,
as is the case with all unsuccessful insurrections,
to extend the power it was intended to
abridge.</p>

<p>The return of the Emperor to Spain filled his
subjects who had been in arms against him with
deep apprehensions; and if they escaped punishment,
it was rather from Charles's own generous
nature than from the forbearance of his minister,
who endeavoured, but in vain, to stir his mind up to
revenge. A general pardon was published, extending
to all crimes committed from the first of
the insurrections, from which a few only were
excepted, and these few rather for the sake of
intimidating others, than from the wish to seize
them. "Go," said the monarch to an officious
courtier who offered to inform him where one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the most considerable lay concealed, "I have
now no reason to be afraid of that man, but he
has some cause to keep at a distance from me,
and you would be better employed in telling him
that I am here, than in acquainting me with the
place of his retreat." By this prudent line of
conduct, by adopting the manners and language
of Spain, and by breaking from the pupillage in
which Chievres had studied to keep him, he
effectually conciliated his subjects. The invasion
of Navarre by the French determined him to
engage in open war with the French king; and
without consulting his minister, whose aversion
to a war with Francis might have thwarted his design,
he had entered into an alliance with the pope
to expel the French out of the Milanese, and to
secure Francis Sforza in possession of that duchy.
No sooner was the treaty signed and imparted to
him, than Chievres was well assured he had lost
his ascendancy; his chagrin on this account is
said to have shortened his days, and his death
left the Emperor to exercise without control
the unbiassed wishes of his own great mind.</p>

<p>The declaration of war against France called
Garcilasso from his studies, and though little more
than eighteen, he commenced his career of arms
in this campaign. Lautrec, to whom the French
forces in Milan were committed, was forced,
not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>withstanding his vigilance and address, to retire
toward the Venetian territories before Colonna
and Pescara, the papal and imperial generals;
by the bravery of the Spanish fusiliers, the city
of Milan was surprised; Parma and Placentia
were reduced by the former, and in a short time
the whole Milanese, except the citadel of Cremona,
submitted to Sforza's authority. To efface
the disasters of this campaign, Francis in 1524
assembled a numerous army, and determined,
notwithstanding the approach of winter and the
dissuasions of his generals, to march into Italy,
and attempt the recovery of the lost territory.
Crossing Mount Cenis, he advanced with an
activity and strength that disconcerted the Imperialists.
They retired precipitately from the
city of Milan; but instead of seizing upon that
favourable moment to attack and disperse them,
the evil genius of Francis led him to turn
aside to besiege Pavia. The battle of Pavia
set the final seal upon his misfortunes. After
romantic deeds of personal bravery, and not
till he had seen the flower of his nobility
perish around him and the fortune of the field
hopeless, he delivered up his sword, and submitted
himself a captive. It does not appear
whether in this memorable engagement Garcilasso
fought under the flag of Pescara or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Marques del Vasto: it is certain, however, that
he distinguished himself by his courage and
heroism, as the emperor, in acknowledgment of
the high regard in which he held his conduct,
conferred on him shortly after the Cross of the
order of St. James.</p>

<p>Previously to the emperor's descent upon Milan,
the state of Venice had been in league with
Francis, and it was the last of his allies who
abandoned him. So long as Charles had to
struggle with his insurgent subjects, and with
formidable enemies elsewhere, he had avoided
increasing their number, and had consented not
to consider the Venetians as at war with him,
notwithstanding the succour which they gave to
France; but now that he felt his power unfettered,
he assumed a loftier tone, and declared
that he would no longer suffer a State almost
surrounded by his own territories, to enjoy the
advantages of peace whilst engaged in constant
hostilities against him.<a name="FNanchor_AB_28" id="FNanchor_AB_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_AB_28" class="fnanchor">[AB]</a> The regret which they
felt to renounce the friendship with France, for
which they had made the greatest sacrifices,
caused the Venetians to hesitate a long time
which of the two powers they should join with.
The ascendancy which Charles was acquiring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Italy at length cut short their deliberation; a
treaty of alliance was entered into with the
emperor, and Andreas Navagero and Lorenzo
Priuli, afterwards doge, were appointed ambassadors
to the Spanish court. At Pisa, however,
they received orders to await the issue of
the siege of Pavia; and it was not till they had
received intelligence of the defeat of Francis,
that they proceeded on their embassy. They
were met on their entrance into the city of
Toledo,<a name="FNanchor_AC_29" id="FNanchor_AC_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_AC_29" class="fnanchor">[AC]</a> where the court at that time was, by the
Admiral of the Indies, who was a young son
of Columbus,<a name="FNanchor_AD_30" id="FNanchor_AD_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_AD_30" class="fnanchor">[AD]</a> by the Bishop of Avenea, and the
whole suite of foreign ambassadors. Navagero
was a scholar and a poet. Born of one of the
noblest families of Venice, and naturally inclined
to letters, he had devoted his youth to study with
so much severity, as to occasion a melancholy
which he was obliged to divert by frequent travel
and relinquishment of the pursuits he loved. He
was no less distinguished for Greek learning than
for the ease and elegance of his Latin compositions,
and for his taste in Italian poetry, a taste
so fastidious that he was rarely satisfied with any
thing he wrote, so that he is said to have
de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>stroyed, a few hours before his death, not only
the greater part of a History of Venice, which
he had been charged to write when appointed
librarian of the public library of Saint Mark, but
many of his Italian poems, which fell short of his
high standard of excellence. Such as are extant
are sufficient to justify the great applause which
he received from his
cotemporaries.<a name="ENanchor_4" id="ENanchor_4"></a><a href="#Endnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Navagero
enjoys the additional distinction of having originated
the improvement that was derived to
Spanish poesy from the naturalization of Italian
metres and Italian taste, as hitherto both Garcilasso
and Bosc&aacute;n had restricted their genius to
compositions in the redondilla measure. The
circumstance that first led to their relinquishment
of the antique models, is narrated by Bosc&aacute;n
himself, in the Dedication of the second volume
of his poems to the Duchess of Soma.<a name="FNanchor_AE_31" id="FNanchor_AE_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_AE_31" class="fnanchor">[AE]</a></p>

<p>"Conversing one day," says he, "on literary
subjects, with Navagero the Venetian ambassador
(whom I wish to name to your ladyship
as a man of great celebrity in these days), and
particularly upon the different genius of many
languages, he inquired of me why in Castilian
we had never attempted sonnets and other kinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of composition used by the best writers in Italy;
he not only said this, he urged me to set the
example. A few days after I departed home,
and musing on a variety of things during the
long and solitary journey, frequently reflected
on Navagero's advice, and thus at length began
the attempt. I found at first some difficulty, as
this kind of versification is extremely complex,
and has many peculiarities different from ours;
but afterwards, from the partiality we naturally
entertain towards our own productions, I thought
I had succeeded well, and gradually grew warm
and eager in the pursuit. This however would
not have been sufficient to stimulate me to proceed,
had not Garcilasso encouraged me, whose
judgment, not only in my opinion, but in that of
the whole world, is esteemed a certain rule.
Praising uniformly my essays, and giving me
the highest possible mark of approbation in
following himself my example, he induced me
to devote myself exclusively to the undertaking."</p>

<p>The noiseless tenour of a country life and calm
domestic pleasure which Bosc&aacute;n now enjoyed,
so different from the agitations of the camp to
which his friend was subjected, fortunately concurred
to favour the poet's scheme. He had for
the last four years travelled much, or devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his principal attention to the education of Fernando
de Toledo, afterwards the celebrated Duke
of Alva; but having married the lady Anna
Giron de Rebolledo, an amiable woman of noble
family, he seems now to have given himself up
without distraction to his favourite pursuit, and
to have presented himself as a reformer of the
lyric poetry of his nation, in pursuance of
Navagero's advice. He began to study with
greater closeness the Tuscan poets, the sonnets
of Petrarch, the terze rime of Dante, and the
octaves of Bembo, Politian, and Ariosto. The
Castilian songs, so pleasing to his nation, compared
with those more perfect models, seemed
to him comparatively barbarous; he resolved
to effect the overthrow of the existing laws
of Castilian versification, and to introduce new
ones, on a system directly the reverse. The
old Castilian measure in short verses, which constituted
the actual national poetry, proceeded
always from long to short; it consisted of four
trochees in succession; Bosc&aacute;n substituted
iambics as in Italian, and made the movement
of the verse proceed from short to long. The
old poets scarcely ever made use but of redondillas
of six and eight syllables, and of
verses <i>de arte mayor</i> of twelve. Bosc&aacute;n took a
medium between both, in adopting the heroic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Italian endecasyllabic verse of five iambics with
a conclusive breve; a measure which wonderfully
enlarged the powers and sphere of Spanish
poetry, as the redondillas were by no means
fitted for any of the higher kinds of composition.
The outcry, however, that was raised at
first against this innovation by the host of poets
who could conceive nothing excellent but what
accorded with their own habits, caused him to
reflect seriously on his enterprise. Some of his
opponents alleged that the old measures were sufficiently
melodious; some, that the new verses
had nothing to distinguish them from prose;
and others even that the poesies which Bosc&aacute;n
took for his model, had something in them
effeminate, and were fit only for Italians and for
women. It was then, when encouragement was
most needed, that Garcilasso, returned from Italy,
gave his voice in favour of the poet, and confirmed
him in the undertaking by his own effective
example. His Sonnets were the first of his compositions
which Garcilasso wrote on the new
system. The form of the sonnet had been long
known in Spain, but the genius of the language
had seemed repugnant to its successful structure.
Bosc&aacute;n however fully succeeded in naturalizing
it, though he failed to communicate to it the
sweet reverie of the Tuscan melodist. Garci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>lasso
approached much nearer the softness and
sweetness of his model, and has left a few
pre-eminently beautiful, which may be placed,
without fear from the comparison, by the side of
even Petrarch's: several of them, it is true,
exhibit a refinement of thought that often verges
upon hyperbole and affectation; but in extenuation
of this fault, let it not be forgotten that the
language of gallantry of those times was made up
wholly of artifices of thought, and that the practice
of Petrarch had sanctioned their adoption in
song. Garcilasso's admiration of Petrarch, which
led him to imitate his tone of lamenting love,
would be strengthened in that choice of subject
by his passion for an Arragonese lady, a cousin-german
to the Count of Miranda, and maid of
honour to Leonora, Queen of France, to whom
it is probable many of them were addressed, and
who it would appear from them as well as from
his odes, subjected the sincerity and steadiness
of his attachment to an ordeal sufficiently
severe. More kind however than the Laura of
Petrarch, or unpreoccupied in her affections,
Helen de Zu&ntilde;iga at length acknowledged her
sense of his merit, and yielded him her hand.
Their marriage was celebrated in the palace of
the Queen of France,<a name="FNanchor_AF_32" id="FNanchor_AF_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_AF_32" class="fnanchor">[AF]</a> in 1528, in our poet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
twenty-fifth year. It would seem from some
coplas of his, which must have been written
early in life, that he had been unsuccessful in his
first choice, the verses in question exhibiting all
that resentment and reproach softening into tenderness,
which is the natural course of feeling
under disappointment to a mind warm in the hopes
and visions it indulges and proudly conscious
of its own deserts, yet unchanging in the current
of that one emotion into which all its thoughts
have set. But whatever might have been his
sufferings under this severe privation, it is
natural to suppose that time had softened them
into that mild melancholy which we trace in
almost all his writings, and that they were recompensed
by the happiness he now enjoyed in a
home, where, in the words of one who has
realized himself the picture&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;Love and lore might claim alternate hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Peace embosomed in Idalian bowers.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At this time, the celebrated 'Libro del Cortegiano'
of Castiglione first made its appearance.
It was every where read in Italy with the greatest
avidity. The moral and political instruction
which her people met in every page of that
charming performance, enriched as it was with the
flower of Greek and Roman wit, of the sciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and liberal arts, the easy and natural style of
elegance in which its precepts were conveyed, the
lively pictures it presented of characters whom all
Italy knew, and above all, its pure and beautiful
Tuscan, that 'poetry of speech' so dear to them,
used too with such grace by a Lombard writer,
delighted and surprised them. From Italy it
passed immediately into Spain, where it was
equally well received. The Spaniards read it
with the greater interest, having before their
eyes the fine qualities of Castiglione himself.
This accomplished nobleman had been sent by
Pope Clement in 1520, as ambassador to Spain,
where he acquired, in a singular degree, the
esteem and affection of the Emperor, and of the
gentlemen of his court. Desirous that a work
of so much merit should be naturalized in
Castile, Garcilasso urged Bosc&aacute;n to translate it.
It was done, and immediately printed, with a
prefatory letter from Garcilasso to the lady
Geronyma Palova de Almogavar, who seems to
have originated the task; a composition no less
interesting from its ingenuity and grace of
thought, than from its being the only one that
remains to us of our poet's
letters.<a name="ENanchor_5" id="ENanchor_5"></a><a href="#Endnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It must
have been highly gratifying to Castiglione to see
his "Book of Gold," as the Italians in their
admiration call it, circulated through Spain by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the medium of her two principal geniuses. But
he did not live long to enjoy this literary reputation.
Falling sick at Toledo, he died in February
1529, to the extreme grief of the Emperor, who
commanded all the prelates and lords of his
court to attend the body to the principal church
there; and the funeral offices were celebrated by
the Archbishop with a pomp never before permitted
to any but princes of the blood.</p>

<p>The invasion of Hungary by Solyman, the
Turkish Sultan, in 1532, summoned Garcilasso
from the blandishments alike of Beauty and the
Muse. At the instigation of John, the Waywode
of Transylvania, that daring prince had laid
siege to Vienna; but finding it bravely defended
by Philip the Count Palatine, he was obliged to
abandon it with disgrace. To repair the discredit
of that retreat, he now prepared to enter
Austria with more numerous forces. Charles,
resolving to undertake the campaign in person,
raised on his part the forces of the empire, and
all Europe with eager attention expected the
contest. But either monarch dreaded the power
and talent of his antagonist, each conducted his
operations with great caution, and Solyman,
finding it impossible to gain ground upon an
enemy so wary, marched back towards the end
of autumn. Garcilasso was engaged in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
skirmishes with the Turks, and has drawn in
his second eclogue some interesting pictures
of the events of the campaign. Whilst at
Vienna, a romantic adventure at court drew
upon him the displeasure of the emperor. One
of his cousins, a son of Don Pedro Lasso, fell in
love with Donna Isabel, daughter of D. Luis de la
Cueva, and maid of honour to the empress; and as
his views were honourable, Garcilasso favoured
by all means in his power this passion of his
relative. The resentment which Charles displayed
on a discovery of the amour can scarcely
be accounted for, but by supposing the lady to
have been a favourite of the monarch himself.
As a punishment for their indiscretion or presumption,
Charles banished the cousin, and
confined Garcilasso in an isle of the Danube,
where he composed the ode in which he proudly
deplores his misfortune, and celebrates the
charms of the country watered by the divine
Danube (Danubio, rio divino). The marriage he
had laboured to promote did not take effect, and
the lady became afterwards Countess of Santist&eacute;van.
How long Garcilasso remained in confinement
is not now to be ascertained, but it is
probable the monarch's severity soon softened
towards him; the expedition he meditated against
Tunis would remind him of the bravery he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
displayed in past engagements, and suggest the
propriety of forgiveness and reconciliation. He
was recalled, and desired to attend the Emperor
to Tunis.</p>

<p>The daring courage of the corsair Barbarossa,
the son of a potter at Lesbos, had recommended
him to the friendship of the king of Algiers:
having made himself master of twelve galleys, he
was received as an ally, murdered, and seized the
sceptre of the monarch to whose assistance he
had sailed. Putting his dominions under the protection
of the Grand Seignior, he was offered the
command of a Turkish fleet, availed himself of
the rival claims that distracted Tunis, made a
descent upon the city, and obliged Muley Hascen
the king to fly before him. Muley Hascen
escaped to Spain, and presented himself a suppliant
before the Imperial throne. Compassionating
his misfortunes, and animated at once
by a thirst for fame, and a desire to punish the
pirate, whose depredations were the subject of
continual complaint, Charles readily yielded to
his entreaties; he declared his design to command
in person the armament destined for the invasion
of Tunis; and the united strength of his vast
dominions was called out upon the enterprise.
Nor was Barbarossa destitute of either vigour
or prudence in preparing for his defence. He
strengthened the citadel of Tunis, fortified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Goletta, and assembled 20,000 horse, and a considerable
body of foot; but his chief confidence
was placed in the strength of the Goletta. This
was a castle on the narrow straits of a gulf formed
by the sea, extending nearly to Tunis, of which
it formed the key. This fort he garrisoned with
6,000 Turkish soldiers, under the command of
Sinan, a renegado Jew, one of the bravest and
most experienced of the corsairs. The Emperor,
landing his forces, invested it the 19th of June,
1535. Frequent skirmishes took place with the
Turks and Arabs, who sallied from the fortress
with loud shouts to the sound of trumpets and of
cymbals, and once or twice surprising the Imperial
forces before break of day, committed great
slaughter. In one of these fierce encounters,
Garcilasso was wounded in the face and hand,
as he himself declares in a sonnet to his friend
Mario Galeota. Notwithstanding the resolution
of Sinan, however, and the valour of Barbarossa,
the breaches of the Goletta soon became considerable.
The Spaniards battered the bastion
on the shore; the Italians the new works which
the Moors had raised towards the canal. The
battery continued for six or seven hours without
remission, in which time above four thousand
bullets were fired, but to great effect, bringing
down a great part of the fort with the cannon on
it. The Emperor having sent to view the breach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
conferred with his officers, and addressing a few
words to the soldiers of each nation, gave orders
for the last assault. Led and encouraged by a
Franciscan friar, carrying a crucifix, the Spaniards
pushed fiercely forward, and in a short time all the
four nations made their way through the breaches,
driving the Moors before them, who at first gave
way gently, but soon fled with precipitation,
throwing away their arms. To men who were
taught to consider it meritorious to destroy the
Infidels, pity was a thing unknown: the slaughter
was great, and those of the enemy that guarded
the entrenchment towards the canal, unable to get
over by reason of the throng, threw themselves
into the water to escape. Upwards of 80 galleys
were taken, and 400 pieces of cannon, many of
them marked with fleurs de lys. The same day
the emperor entered Goletta through the breach,
and turning to Muley Hascen, who accompanied
him&mdash;"Here," said he, "is the open gate by
which you shall return to take possession of your
throne."</p>

<p>Barbarossa, though sufficiently concerned for
the fall of Goletta, lost not his accustomed
courage. He mustered for the defence of Tunis
all his forces, amounting to 150,000 men, Moors,
Turks, Arabs, and Janizaries, of which 13,000
had muskets or cross-bows, and 30,000 were
mounted on fleet horses. Confident in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
numbers, he resolved to hazard a battle, and
marched out to meet the enemy, having in vain
attempted to persuade his officers to massacre
10,000 Christian captives confined in the citadel,
lest in the absence of the army they should
overpower their guards. Knowing that the
Imperialists were in great want of water, he took
possession of a plain divided into orchards and
olive-grounds, where there were numerous wells
among certain ruins of old arches by which the
Carthaginians used to convey water to the city.
There he placed about 12,000 Turks and renegadoes,
all musqueteers, who formed his chief
confidence; 12,000 horse he marshalled along
the canal, and disposed several other squadrons
of horse among the olive-gardens, to shelter them
from the scorching sun; his multitudes of foot
he placed in the rear. Then, distributing amongst
them abundance of water brought upon mules
and camels, and inculcating on his men how easy
the victory would be over so few Christians,
and those spent with thirst, fatigue, and heat,
he awaited the Emperor's approach. Arrived
within sight of the Africans, Charles posted his
Italian foot on the side of the canal, the pikes
close to the water, and next to them the Germans.
On the right towards the olive-gardens,
together with the light-horse, were the veteran
Spaniards that had served in Italy; between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
these wings was the cannon, guarded by the
choicest of the army; and the new-raised
Spaniards brought up the rear with some horse,
commanded by the Duke of Alva. The Emperor
himself rode about with his naked sword, ranging
and encouraging his men. With loud shouts
of Lillah il Allah, the Moors and Arabs rushed
to the attack. The latter, taking a compass by
the olive-gardens, fell on the rear, where they
were warmly received by the Duke of Alva, and
the battle became general. The barbarians
tossing their darts, and shooting their arrows
from the trees, greatly galled the Imperialists,
which the emperor perceiving, sent forward the
Italians, several of the German veterans, and
his Spanish cohorts, commanded by the Marquis
de Mondejar, who had been set to guard the
baggage between the artillery and the rear. For
awhile it was fought with various success, as
although the foot went on prosperously, the
Spanish cavalry were wavering before the
impetuous charge of the Numidian and Turkish
horse. The Marquis de Mondejar was deeply
wounded in the throat by a Moorish lance, and
was with difficulty saved. It was then that
Garcilasso rushed forward amongst the thickest
of the enemy, and amply atoned for the absence
of the general. With his invincible sword, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
clove in two the shields and turbans of the
bravest Turks, and by his example quickened
the drooping courage of those about him. But
the Africans in fresh swarms poured around;
and inclosed on all sides, and already wounded,
he must have fallen a victim to his valour,
if a noble Neapolitan, Federico Carafa by
name, had not at the imminent peril of his own
life generously resolved upon his rescue; by
great efforts he at length succeeded in dispersing
the multitude, and bore him back in safety, but
half-spent with toil, thirst, and loss of blood.<a name="FNanchor_AG_33" id="FNanchor_AG_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_AG_33" class="fnanchor">[AG]</a>
Meanwhile the Duke of Alva had put to flight
the Arabs, and the Imperial musqueteers keeping
up a constant fire did great execution, so that
the foe shortly quitted their posts in the utmost
confusion; and though Barbarossa did all he could
to rally them, the rout became so general, that
he himself was hurried with them in their flight
back to the city, leaving the Christians in possession
of his cannon, and of the wells of water,
which prevented the pursuit; for the soldiers,
almost mad with thirst and heat, ran to drink
in such confusion, that the infidels might have
redeemed the lost field if their panic had been
less. The victory however was complete, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
gained, according to Sandoval, with the loss of
only twenty men. Barbarossa, on gaining Tunis,
found his affairs desperate; some of the inhabitants
flying with their families and effects,
others ready to set open the gates to the conqueror,
and the Christian slaves in possession of
the citadel. These unhappy men, on the defeat
of the army, had been consigned to destruction.
A Turk came with powder and a lighted match to
blow them up, when one of the captives near
the gate ran forward in desperation, snatched a
target and scimeter from the nearest officer, and
drove the Turk out; the rest having gained two
of the keepers, by their assistance knocked off
their fetters, burst open the prisons, overpowered
the Turkish garrison, and turned the artillery of
the fort against their former masters. Barbarossa,
cursing at one time the false compassion of his
officers, and at others the treachery of the
Prophet, fled precipitately to Bona; upon which
a Xeque came from the suburbs, and submitted to
the emperor the keys of the city. Muley Hascen,
restored to his throne, consented to do homage
for the crown of Tunis; and Charles, setting
at liberty the Christian slaves of all nations
without ransom, re-embarked for Europe, and
returning through Italy, was every where honoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
with triumphs, and complimented in panegyrics
by her orators and poets.</p>

<p>Garcilasso, on his return from this expedition,
spent some time in Sicily and Naples, in the
society perhaps of the young Neapolitan who had
so nobly saved his life; and in communion with
the Italian literati, and in the composition of his
eclogues, the autumn months doubtless rolled
delightfully away. The romantic scenery of
Sicily would suggest to his fancy a thousand
charming images; and passionately fond as he
ever was of the country, its quiet and repose
would after the tumult of battle fall upon his
spirit with peculiar sweetness. He in fact,
notwithstanding some melancholy anticipations
arising from the chequered incidents of his past
life, which are met with in his poems of this
period, seems to have luxuriated in the delicious
idlesse of such a cessation, in so beautiful a
country, at so enchanting a season, with a delight
similar to that which Rousseau describes himself
as tasting in his solitary summer rambles in
Switzerland; whilst the Genius of Poesy, amid
the steeps and shades which he haunted, unlocked
in his mind her divinest reveries, and casting round
his footsteps 'her bells and flowerets of a
thousand hues,' submitted to his lips the pastoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
flute of Theocritus and Virgil, from which in the
mellow noon, amidst the rich red chesnut woods,
he struck out sounds that had not for many ages
been listened to by the ear of Dryad, or of Faun.
In Sicily, from the foot of Mount Etna, he sent
to Bosc&aacute;n and the young Duke of Alva, his
pensive elegies; at Naples, penetrated with all
the spirit of Maro and Sannazaro, he composed
the first and finest of his eclogues, which has
served as a model to a crowd of imitators, who
have been all unable to approach it. The celebrity
he had acquired by his actions and his
compositions, caused his society to be courted by
all of illustrious birth or intellectual endowments,
whilst his engaging manners and amability of
disposition increased the admiration excited by
his talents, and caused him to be beloved wherever
he went. Cardinal Bembo, whose Italian writings
he always admired, and sometimes imitated,
and whose Spanish poems are highly praised by
Muratori for their purity and elegance, thus
writes of him in Tuscan to one of his friends, the
monk Onorato Fascitelo, in a letter dated from
Padua, Aug. 10, 1535:&mdash;"I have seen the letter
of the Rev. Father Girolamo Seripando; concerning
the Odes of Sig. Garcilasso which he sent
me, I can very easily and willingly satisfy him,
assuring him that that gentleman is indeed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
graceful poet, that the Odes are all in the highest
degree pleasing to me, and merit peculiar admiration
and praise. In fine spirit, he has far
excelled all the writers of his nation, and if he be
not wanting to himself in diligent study, he will
no less excel those of other nations who are
considered masters of poetry. I am not surprised
that, as the Rev. Father writes me word, the
Marquis del Vasto has wished to have him with
him, and that he holds him in great affection.
I beg you to take care that the Signior may know
how highly I esteem him, and how desirous I am
to continue to be loved as I perceive myself to be
by a gentleman so illustrious."<a name="FNanchor_AH_34" id="FNanchor_AH_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_AH_34" class="fnanchor">[AH]</a></p>

<p>Amidst the Cardinal's Latin letters, I find one
of great elegance to Garcilasso himself, filled
with the same kind expressions of esteem and
admiration.<a name="FNanchor_AI_35" id="FNanchor_AI_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_AI_35" class="fnanchor">[AI]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">"<i>Naples.</i></p>

<p class="center">CARDINAL BEMBO TO GARCILASSO THE CASTILIAN OFFERS HEALTH AND PEACE.</p>

<p>From the verses which you have written for my
perusal, I am happy to perceive, first, how much you
love me, since you are not one who would else flatter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>with encomiums, or call one dear to you whom you
had never seen; and, secondly, how much you excel
in lyric compositions, in splendour of genius, and
sweetness of expression. The first gives me the
greatest pleasure, for what is comparable to the love
and esteem of a fine poet? All other things, how
dear and honourable soever they are considered by
mankind, perish in a very short time, together with
their possessors. Poets only live, are long-lived, and
immortal, and impart the same life and immortality on
whom they will. As concerns the latter division of
your qualities, you have not only surpassed in the
poetical art all your fellow Spaniards who have devoted
themselves to Parnassus and the Muses, but you supply
incentives even to the Italians, and again and again
excite them to endeavour to be overcome in this contest
and in these studies by no one but yourself. Which
judgment of mine, some other of your writings sent to
me at Naples have confirmed. For it is impossible to
meet in this age with compositions more classically
pure, more dignified in sentiment, or more elegant in
style. In that you love me, therefore, I most justly
and sincerely rejoice; that you are a great and good
man, I congratulate, in the first place yourself, but
most of all your country, in that she is thus about to
receive so great an increase of honour and of glory.
There is, however, another circumstance which greatly
increases the pleasure I have received; for lately,
when the monk Onorato, whom I perceive you know
by reputation, entered into conversation with me, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>amongst other topics, asked me what I thought of
your poems, the opinion I gave happened to coincide
exactly with his own, (and he is a man of very acute
perception, and extremely well versed in poetical pursuits.)
He told me what his friends had written to him
of your very many and great virtues, of the urbanity of
your manners, the integrity of your life, and accomplishments
of your mind; adding, that it was a fact
confirmed by the assurances of all Neapolitans that
knew you, that no one had come from Spain to their
city in these times wherein the greatest resort has
been made by your nation to Italy, whom they loved
more affectionately than yourself, or one on whom they
would confer superior benefits. Thus I consider it an
advantage to have received your good wishes, by no
trouble of my own, and that you should have so far
loved me as even to adorn me by the illustrious herald
of your muse. Wherefore, if I do not in the highest
degree love and esteem you in return, I shall think I
act by no means as a gentleman. But from the first I
have resolved to give you a proof of my respect and
love, and earnestly recommend to your notice the said
Onorato, who has a great affection for you, and who is
now setting out to pay you a visit; that hence you may
best know what to promise yourself respecting me,
when you see that I dare ask of you what I have
decided to be most desirable for myself. I believe you
know that the patrimony of his brothers, worthy and
harmless men, was plundered in the Italian wars, from
no provocation on their part; I will therefore say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>nothing on this head. But now that they have come to a
resolution to solicit of the emperor, the best of kings
and princes, what they have unjustly lost, they will
have hopes, if they obtain your assistance, of recovering
easily what they honourably desire; so great is your
friendship, influence, and authority with him, and with
all who are dearest to him. I therefore earnestly
solicit you to take up the matter, that by your kind
mediation his brothers and family may be restored to
their former state of fortune: you will thus firmly
secure to yourself the most honourable of men, but me
you will so highly oblige, that I shall consider the gift
of their patrimony made as to myself; for I love
Onorato as a brother, I esteem him more than the
generality of my friends; and so desirous am I that
through your obliging offices this affair may have the
issue which he hopes, that his own brother could not
more ardently wish or labour for it than I really do.
But I trust that as you love me of your own good
pleasure, you will quickly relieve me of this concern
by the address in which you excel, and by that
amiable ingenuity which endears you so to all. Which
that you may do, relying on the excellence of your
disposition, not as a new friend modestly and submissively,
but as old and peculiar friends are wont,
I again and again entreat you.
Farewell."<a name="ENanchor_6" id="ENanchor_6"></a><a href="#Endnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The quiet enjoyment, however, of alternate
study and society which Garcilasso thus
pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>sessed, was of no long continuance. It was his
fate to be called perpetually from his favourite
pursuits to scenes of strife from which his mind
revolted, and his writings show how keenly he
felt the change. A fresh war summoned him
to the field. Francis had taken advantage of the
emperor's absence to revive his claims in Italy,
and the death of Sforza strengthened the ground
of his pretensions. Charles acted the part of a
skilful diplomatist; he appeared to admit the
equity of the claim, and entered into negotiations
respecting the disputed territory, till he should
be better able to cope with his antagonist. But no
sooner had he recruited his armies and finances,
than he threw off the mask of moderation, and
driving the forces of his rival from Piedmont and
Savoy, invaded, though contrary to the advice of
his ministers and generals, the southern provinces
of France. Garcilasso, on his way from Naples
to join the army, wrote from Vaucluse his Epistle
to Bosc&aacute;n, concluding it with a gaiety in which
he seldom indulges, and which, coupled in our
mind with the reflection that his end was near,
has something in it singularly affecting. To the
period also of this campaign, I should ascribe
the composition of his third eclogue, avowedly
written in the tent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Midst arms, with scarce one pause from bloody toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where war's hoarse trumpet breaks the poet's dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have I these moments stolen, oft claimed again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now taking up the sword, and now the pen."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this ill-starred expedition, Garcilasso was
entrusted with the command of thirty companies
of Spanish troops. The Marechal de Montmorency,
to whom the French army was committed,
resolved to act wholly on the defensive, to weary
out the enemy by delay, and by laying waste the
country around to deprive him of subsistence.
This plan, to which he inflexibly adhered, had all
the effect he desired. After unsuccessfully investing
Marseilles and Arles, with his troops
wasted by famine or disease, the emperor was
under the necessity of ordering a retreat. In
this retreat, effected with much disorder and with
more precipitation, his army suffered a thousand
calamities. Crowds of peasants, eager to be
revenged on a foe, through whom their cultured
fields had been turned into a frightful desert,
lying ambushed in the lanes and mountainous
defiles which overhung their way, by frequent
attacks, now in front, now in the rear, kept them
in perpetual alarm; nor was there a day passed
without their being obliged, every two or three
hundred paces, to stand and defend themselves.
The farther they advanced, the more their difficulties
increased. At Muy, near Frejus, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
army was put to a stand. A body of fifty rustics,
armed with muskets, had thrown themselves into
a tower, and inconsiderable as they were in
number prevented its progress. The emperor
ordered Garcilasso to advance with his battalion,
and attack the place. Gratified with this mark
of his sovereign's confidence, and eager for distinction,
he planted his scaling-ladders, and
prepared for the ascent. The simple peasants,
seeing the decorated garment which he wore
over his armour, and the high honour that was
every where paid him by the soldiers whose
motions he directed, supposed it to be the emperor
himself, and marked him out for destruction.<a name="FNanchor_AJ_36" id="FNanchor_AJ_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_AJ_36" class="fnanchor">[AJ]</a>
With showers of missiles and the fire of
musquetry, they saluted the assailants, whom however
they could neither check nor dismay. Garcilasso
himself, cheering on his men, was the first
that mounted the ladder, and was perhaps the
only individual who in this disastrous campaign
acquired any splendid addition to what would
be considered his military glory. But his life
was destined to be the price of this distinction.
A block of stone, rolled over the battlements
by the combined strength of numbers, fell upon
his shielded helmet, and beat him to the ground.
He was borne to Nice, where after lingering four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and twenty days he expired, November 1536;
showing, says D. T. Tamaio de Vargas, no less
the spirit of a Christian in his last moments, than
that of a soldier in the perils he had braved.
Every one was penetrated with sorrow at the loss
of one so deservedly dear; but the Emperor was
so deeply afflicted, that having taken the tower,
he caused twenty-eight of the peasants, the only
survivors of the escalade, to be instantly hung;
giving thus a strong, though at the same time a
barbarous proof of the esteem and affection he
entertained for Garcilasso. Thus perished, at the
early age of thirty-three, Garcilasso de la Vega, a
youth of whom no record remains but what is
honourable to his character and talents, and who
conferred more real glory on his country by his
pen, than all the conquests of the mighty Charles,
achieved by his ambitious sword. With every
mark and ceremonial of public respect, his body
was conveyed to the church of St. Domingo,
at Nice; whence it was afterwards in 1538
removed to Spain, and finally deposited in a
chapel of the church of San Pedro Martyr de
Toledo, the ancient sepulchre of his ancestors,
the Lords of Batres.</p>

<p>Garcilasso left three sons and a daughter. His
eldest son, named also Garcilasso, as he grew up
was highly distinguished by the emperor, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
seemed to find a melancholy pleasure in having
him near his person. He too fell in the field at
the yet earlier age of twenty-four, fighting valiantly
at the battle of Ulpian: he lies beside his
father. Francisco de Figueroa has celebrated his
fall in a sonnet, too beautiful to be here omitted.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>His second son, Francisco de Guzman, entered
a convent of Dominicans, and became a great
theologian. Lorenzo de Guzman, his youngest
son, was distinguished by much of his father's
genius, and highly esteemed as such by Don
Ant. Augustin, most illustrious, says Vargas, in
dignity and doctrine, who, being banished to
Oran for a lampoon, died upon the passage.
Donna Sancha de Guzman, the poet's daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
married D. Antonio Portocarrero de Vega, a son
of the Count of Palma, who had married Garcilasso's
sister. The grandson of Don Pedro
Lasso was created Count of Los Arcos, and
Charles the Second created his descendant, D.
Joachim Lasso de la Vega, the third Count of
Los Arcos, a Grandee of Spain, October, 1697.<a name="FNanchor_AK_37" id="FNanchor_AK_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_AK_37" class="fnanchor">[AK]</a></p>

<p>Garcilasso in person was above the middle
size; with perfect symmetry of figure, he had
such dignity of deportment, that strangers who
knew him not were sensible at once that they
were in the presence of some superior personage.
His features corresponded with his deportment;
his countenance, not without a shade of seriousness,
was expressive of much mildness and benevolence;
he had most lively eyes, his forehead
was expansive, and his whole appearance presented
the picture of manly beauty. Graceful
and genteel in his address, courteous and gallant
in his behaviour, he is said to have been a first
favourite with the ladies; by the most winning
manners he engaged his own sex, and accomplished
as he was in all the duties of knighthood,
he may with much propriety be called the
Sidney or the Surrey of Spain. Notwithstanding
the great favour he enjoyed at court, he passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
through life without incurring the jealousy of the
courtiers; a rare piece of good fortune, which he
owed to some happy art or sincerity of conduct
that disarmed envy. With a disposition peculiarly
affectionate, he was more inclined to praise
than to censure; in the whole course of his
writings, we meet with but one passage that
bears the least approach to satire or severity, and
this he immediately checks, as though it were
something foreign to his nature. He has preserved
in his verses the names of his particular
friends. Bosc&aacute;n was evidently the one whom he
loved with most devotedness; but his attachment
seems also to have been great to the Countess of
Ure&ntilde;a, Donna Maria de la Cueva, to the Marchioness
of Padula, Lady Maria de Cardona, to the
Marquis del Vasto, the Duke of Alva, Don Pedro
de Toledo, Marquis of Villafranca, Julio C&aelig;sar
Caracciola, a Neapolitan poet, and other distinguished
characters, whom he celebrates in his
poems. Bosc&aacute;n charged himself with performing
the last honour to his memory, and published in
1544 their joint productions, under the title of
'Obras de Bosc&aacute;n y Garcilasso.'<a name="FNanchor_AL_38" id="FNanchor_AL_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_AL_38" class="fnanchor">[AL]</a></p>

<p>Had Garcilasso lived longer, his poems would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
probably have been made yet more deserving
of cotemporary praise and the perusal of posterity,
for the relics he has left are to be considered
rather as the early flowers than as the fruits of his
genius; yet from these few blossoms we may
imagine how rich would have been the autumn of
his muse. His style is unaffected, his thoughts
ingenious; the language he uses, though employed
upon lowly subjects, never sinks into
poverty or meanness; he is full of the lights, the
colours, and ornaments which the place and subject
require; and not satisfied often with the
mere production of his sentiments, he amplifies, he
compounds, he illustrates them with admirable
elegance, yet not without suffering his wealth
of ideas frequently to run into diffuseness. He
had at his command a rich variety of significant
words, which he sometimes selects and combines
with so much skill, that the beauty of the words
gives splendour to their disposition, and the
lucidness of disposition lustre to the words;
yet, in some cases, it must be acknowledged,
there is too much involution in the structure of
his sentences. His feelings and sentiments are
either new, or if common, set forth in a certain
manner of his own, which makes them seem so.
The passages he translates from other authors
seem introduced from no ostentation of classical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
pride, but simply to effect the intention he has in
view, and are inlaid with so much art that it
becomes a question whether they give or receive
the ornament. The flowers with which he sprinkles
his poetry seem to spring up spontaneously, the
lights he introduces to fall like unconscious sunshine
to adorn the spot where he has placed them.
His versification, simple, clear, and flowing, has a
purity, music, and dignity of numbers, that ever
and anon seems to bring upon the ear the mellifluous
majesty of Virgil: he tempers the gravity
of his style with such a continuous sweetness as
to form in their union a harmony equally proportioned.
The pause of his verses is always full
of beauty, the closing melody of the sentence
gratifying the reader as he rests. With all his
delicacy of expression and artful sweetness, he
has remarkable pliancy and ease; his only constraint
is that which he himself imposes, when,
abandoning his natural tone of thought, he becomes
a sophist on his feelings, and consents to
surprise by ingenuity when he should affect by
tenderness. Tender, however, he always is in an
eminent degree, whenever he ceases to reason on
his sensations, and gives himself up without
reserve to the promptings of his native sensibility.
His first eclogue breathes throughout a spirit
of melancholy tenderness that speaks eloquently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
to the imagination and the heart. Under the
name of Salicio he unquestionably introduces
himself, and I cannot help thinking that the
shepherd's beautiful lament over the inconstancy
of his mistress owes half its sweetness and pathos
to his own remembrances of the lady whom he
loved in youth. There is a truth and a warmth
of expression in the feelings that could originate
alone from real emotion: nothing can excel the
touching beauty of some of the descriptions.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the charmed ear of what beloved youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounds thy sweet voice? on whom revolvest thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy beautiful blue eyes? on whose sworn truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchors thy broken faith? who presses now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy laughing lip, and hopes thy heaven of charms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Locked in the embracings of thy two white arms?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say thou, for whom hast thou so rudely left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love, or stolen, who triumphs in the theft?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have not yet a bosom so untrue<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The song and sorrow of Salicio seem to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
our interest to the highest point; but the lamentations
of Nemoroso<a name="FNanchor_AM_39" id="FNanchor_AM_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_AM_39" class="fnanchor">[AM]</a> surpass them in depth of
regret, and in the greater variety of sentiments and
images with which the emotions are illustrated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>The whole eclogue is in fact full of poetry, and
from the elegance of its language, its choice
imagery, its soft sweet harmony, and the pastoral
air that pervades it, it must be pronounced the
first composition of its class, not only in Castilian
but Italian poetry. Almost equally admirable,
though different in character, is the third eclogue.
It does not appeal so to the heart, it is less
eloquent, but it is characterised by a finer fancy,
a yet more classical taste, and a more continuous
harmony; and being written in octaves, though
octaves are perhaps somewhat too sounding for
a pastoral, succeeds in gratifying the ear by its
periodical reposes, as well as by its music. In
the whole compass of poetry, I do not remember
a more delicate image than the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All with dishevelled hair were seen to shower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tears o'er the nymph, whose beauty did bespeak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Death had cropt her in her sweetest flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whilst youth bloomed rosiest in her charming cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near the still water, in a cypress bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She lay amongst the green herbs, pale and meek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a white swan that, sickening where it feeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighs its sweet life away amidst the reeds."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The second eclogue is decidedly inferior to the
other two; it is justly to be censured for its
heterogeneous character, its unsatisfactory
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>clusion, and its great lengthiness;<a name="FNanchor_AN_40" id="FNanchor_AN_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_AN_40" class="fnanchor">[AN]</a> but it abounds
with beautiful passages, and the poet's description
of the sculptures on the Urn of Tormes, an
elegant conception, however unsuitably introduced,
is given with an almost lyrical spirit that
half redeems the fault of the episode. Finally,
something very like the light romantic touch of
Lorraine in his delicious landscapes, is to be met
with in the pastoral poetry of Garcilasso; the same
freshness, the same nature, the same selection of
luxuriant images, and harmony of hues. His
elegies are less perfect of their kind; with somewhat
of the softness and philosophy of Tibullus,
they are too frigid and verbose. That to the
Duke of Alva, principally translated from Fracastor,
has however many touches of sensibility;
and a few stanzas, charged with poetical fire, might
be selected from that to Bosc&aacute;n; though from the
excessive and unnatural refinement of thought it
presents upon the whole, it is what I might have
been excused the trouble of translating, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
omission would not have rendered the volume
incomplete. The same fault of frigidity and overmuch
refinement of thought, though variously
modified, applies to many of his sonnets; others
are free from all affectation, and of singular
beauty. His odes are more uniformly excellent.
In the last of them, Garcilasso shows some approach
to a sublimer height than he had yet
aspired to; his lyre assumes in its tones somewhat
of the fervid grandeur that was soon to be
exhibited in the lyric poetry of Torquato Tasso.
In this the shades are darker, the colours more
burning, the thoughts, if I may so say, more
gigantic than in any other of his poems whatever;
yet I cannot consider, the prolonged personification
of Reason, and of its combat with the passions,
which indeed both Bosc&aacute;n and he are apt to dilate
upon till they displease by their monotony, as the
product of a pure taste. I am aware that Muratori,
'suono magnifico,' praises this ode for the very
thing I am condemning;<a name="FNanchor_AO_41" id="FNanchor_AO_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_AO_41" class="fnanchor">[AO]</a>
I shall therefore forbear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
in deference to his authority, to say more; I will
only remark that this example from Garcilasso
comes opportunely for the illustration of his
theory on the personification of speculative
thoughts, and that on this account he may have
looked upon the ode with a somewhat more
favourable eye than his judgment would otherwise
have allowed him to do. He must have
admitted that though personification gives life
and action to images that would else strike the
fancy but feebly, the same artificially extended
through a whole cancion, offends as something
too unnatural to be reconciled to the mind, even
by the beautiful expressions in which it may be
clothed. But whatever difference of opinion may
exist on this, there can be but one sentiment on
the merit of the Ode to the Flower of Gnido.
Elegance, delicacy, harmony, and lyrical spirit,
are all combined in its composition, and fully
authorize the opinion of Paul Jovius, that
it has the sweetness of the odes of Horace;
an opinion confirmed by the praises of our own
countryman, Sir William Jones. Had Garcilasso
written nothing else, this graceful composition
would have sufficed to give his name all the
immortality that waits upon the lyre: it shows
with what success he had studied the classics of
antiquity, and how deeply his mind was imbued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
with their spirit. This pervading spirit it is that
has advanced Garcilasso to the distinction of
being entitled the most classical of all the
Spanish poets; and although from their not having
received his last polish, and from the unfavourable
circumstances under which they were
written, his poems may present some defects
unpleasing to the cultured minds of a more
refined age, such blemishes can be allowed to
subtract neither from this classical reputation,
nor from the deserved admiration with which
their many beauties must be regarded, and the
genius that could give at once, amid the tumult
of the camp, to Spanish poetry a consideration,
and to Spanish language a charm, which in other
countries, are commonly communicated by many,
in the slow course and literary ease of years.</p>

<p>The Works of Garcilasso have engaged in their
illustration the talents of three distinguished
Commentators. The first comment that appeared
was Fernando de Herrera's, published at Seville
in 1580, in small 4to. Living, as Herrera evidently
did, in habits of intimacy with Portocarrero,
it is much to be regretted that he did
not increase the value that was attached to his
work by that full account of the life of Garcilasso
which he had so favourable an opportunity
of obtaining. He excuses himself from the task
by the observation, that it would require a mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
more at leisure than his was, and one gifted with
a happier style of writing; but the world would
probably, with very great willingness, have given
up a part of his commentary, turning as it often
does upon idle disquisitions, to have had its
curiosity gratified on the private habits of his
author; whilst the Lyrist of the battle of Lepanto
should have known that the disclaiming of a
style sufficiently elegant, was a species of mock-modesty
that would not pass wholly uncensured
by posterity. In the year 1612, Sanchez, better
known under the Latin name Brocensis, the
most learned grammarian of Spain, published
at Madrid in 12mo. his commentary, under the
title of 'Obras del excelente Poeta Garcilasso
de la Vega; con anotaciones y emiendas del
Maestro Francisco Sanchez, Catedratico de
retorica de Salamanca.' His illustrations, however,
were principally restricted to a restoration
of the text, for which he deserves very high
praise, and to point out in his author the passages
imitated or translated from other writers, an
elucidation rather curious than useful, as a poet's
works will of themselves, to every scholar</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Their balmy spoils,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>whilst his blind admirers will be apt to quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
with an exposition that may seem at first sight
to detract something from the merit of their idol.
Thus Sanchez, on the publication of his comments,
was assailed by the small wits of the day
with much severity, and some smartness, as will
be seen by the following</p>


<p class="center">SONNET<br />
<i>Against the Annotations of Master Sanchez, found in the house
of a Knight of Salamanca.</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They have discovered a rare theft; the thief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One Garcilasso's taken at his tricks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With three silk canopies and pillows six,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stolen from Queen Dido's bed; young Cupid's sheaf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of darts; the shuttle of the Fates; but chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three most somniferous kegs of Lethe wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his own lady's golden clasp, a sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of turpitude that staggers all belief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For full seven years the sly Arcadian<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has been at work; on shops of Tuscan ware, he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made some attempts too&mdash;Bembo's and Politian's:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis pitiful to hear the' unhappy man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His feet fast in the stocks of Commentary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declaim against these tell-tale rhetoricians.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the back of this paper, Sanchez wrote a
reply.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poets are found whose fame we may immerse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Lethe's wave, who to make up some sonnet<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><span class="i0">Stuff it with pillows till we slumber on it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have recourse for rhymes for their lame verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the sad shuttle of the Fates, or worse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Cupid's darts; whose lines have no more sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than their own lady's golden clasp: yet hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will they denounce our comments for a curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Garcilasso, without knowing why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barking like curs; amusing 'tis to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sapient animals, with long sharp teeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And short dull wits, far falser than the sly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick fidgetings of horses, to get free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of half the imposed light load they bend beneath.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The third annotator is D. Thomas Tamaio de
Vargas. His edition was published in 24mo.
at Madrid, in the year 1622: his comments, filled
with Greek and Latin, with the opinions of Rabbi
Onkelos and St. Cyprian, and quotations from
Geronymo Parabosco, Boethius and Arnobius,
seem to have been written rather to show his
learned reading than to clear up any obscurity he
might find in his author: affixed to his volume
is a 'Life of Garcilasso gathered from his
writings,' which is necessarily meagre and unsatisfactory.
Don Nicolas de Azara, the elegant
translator of Middleton's life of Cicero, has also
illustrated Garcilasso, whose MSS. are deposited
in the library of the Escurial.</p>

<p>The commendations which Garcilasso bestowed
on cotemporary talent, were echoed back with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
equal admiration and sincerity by them and by
succeeding geniuses. Of the Italians, Tansillo
has written two sonnets in his praise, Minturno
two sonnets, Marino a madrigal; Camoens celebrates
him in his letters, Guillaume de Salluste
in his poems. Of his own nation, besides a host
of writers whose names Vargas chronicles with a
jealous care, Herrera, Villegas, and G&oacute;ngora,
Cristoval de Figueroa, Medina, and Barahono de
Soto, wrote Spanish verses, Pachecho and Giron,
Latin verses to his memory. The Abb&eacute; Conti
has translated with fidelity and grace several of
his poems into Tuscan,<a name="FNanchor_AP_42" id="FNanchor_AP_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_AP_42" class="fnanchor">[AP]</a> and Mr. Walpole published,
some few years ago, an English translation
of the First Eclogue, under the title of "Isabel,
with other poems translated from the Spanish;"
which however I have not been able to meet with,
as the author is understood to have called it in
from circulation. Mr. Nott, the industrious commentator
and accomplished scholar, in his Works
of Surrey and Wyatt, pays an elegant tribute to
the talents of Garcilasso, and draws a happy
parallel between him and our Surrey. "They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
both," he observes, "glowed with a generous
love of enterprise, and both were distinguished
by their military ardour in the field. They both
devoted the short intervals of their leisure to the
improvement of their native tongue; they both
formed themselves on Virgil and the Italian
school; both had minds susceptible of love and
friendship; both were constant in their attachments;
both died immaturely, and left in the
bosoms of the good and learned unavailing regret
at their untimely loss."<a name="FNanchor_AQ_43" id="FNanchor_AQ_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_AQ_43" class="fnanchor">[AQ]</a> Yet with this regret
the good and the learned may blend the happier
feeling of dignified delight. There is no stain on
the treasures they have left. The talents with
which they were gifted, were properly cultivated;
the instruments of music which they touched
with so much tenderness, were wreathed around
with none but innocent flowers&mdash;were devoted
alone to the gratification of the generous sensibilities
of our nature. Not a single string of
those they struck, had in its sound the dissonance
of vice&mdash;that one grand discord, which not the
harmonies of all the others can in the ear of true
Taste ever overpower. Let this be their most
successful title to applause; there can be no nobler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
aim marked out for young genius, in an age when
the sister-melodies of Virtue and the Lyre are in
danger of becoming, like Helena and Hermia,
separate and estranged, than the ambition to have
it said of him in after days: 'he had nothing to
reproach himself with in his devotion to the
Muses; he sang like Surrey and Garcilasso de
la Vega.'</p>

<span class="i0">Ev'n now, I seem to see thee pale recline<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy most trying crisis, and to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plaintive murmurs of that voice divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose tones might touch the ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blustering winds, and silence their dispute;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gentle voice (now mute)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to the merciless Lucina prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In utter agony, for aid&mdash;for aid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, for thine appeal! Discourteous power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where wert thou gone in that momentous hour?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or wert thou in the grey woods hunting deer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with thy shepherd boy entranced? Could aught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palliate thy rigorous cruelty, to turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away thy scornful, cold, indifferent ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my moist prayers, by no affliction moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sentence one, so beauteous and beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the funereal urn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, not to mark the throes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Nemoroso suffered, whose concern<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span><span class="i0">It ever was, when pale the morning rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive the mountain beasts into his toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on thy holy altars heap the spoils;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, ungrateful! smiling with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could'st leave my nymph to die before my sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Divine Eliza! since the sapphire sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou measurest now on angel-wings, and feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sandalled with immortality, oh why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me forgetful? Wherefore not entreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hurry on the time when I shall see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veil of mortal being rent in twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smile that I am free?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the third circle of that happy land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we not seek together, hand in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another lovelier landscape, a new plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Other romantic streams and mountains blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh flowery vales, and a new shady shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where I may rest, and ever in my view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep thee, without the terror and surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of being sundered more!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ne'er had the shepherds ceased these songs, to which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hills alone gave ear, had they not seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun in clouds of gold and crimson rich<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descend, and twilight sadden o'er the green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But noting now, how rapidly the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed from the hills, admonishing to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad musicians, by the blushful light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lingering Hesperus, themselves addressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fold their flocks, and step by step withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through bowery lawns and pastures wet with dew.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Temperate, when winter waves its snowy wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the sweet water of this sylvan spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the heats of summer scorch the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More cold than snow: in your clear looking-glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair waves! the memory of that day returns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which my soul still shivers, melts, and burns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing on your clear depth and lustre pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My peace grows troubled, and my joy obscure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recovering you, I lose all self-content:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom, alas, could equal pains be sent!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scenes that would soothe another's pangs to peace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The verdant forests waving with the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The odours wafted from the mead, the flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the wild bee sits and sings for hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These might the moodiest misanthrope employ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make sound the sick, and turn distress to joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only in this waste of sweetness pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death! oh beauty, rising to divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh curls of gold! oh eyes that laughed with light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh swanlike neck! oh hand as ivory white!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could an hour so mournful ever rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To change a life so blest to tears and sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such glittering treasures into dust! I range<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From place to place, and think, perhaps the change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The change may partly temper and control<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ceaseless flame that thus consumes my soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deceitful thought! as though so sharp a smart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By my departure must itself depart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor languid limbs, the grief is but too deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tires you out! Oh that I could but sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here for awhile! the heart awake to pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance in slumbers and calm dreams might gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimpse of the peace with which it pants to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though false as fair, and fugitive as sweet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, amiable kind Sleep, descend, descend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee my wearied spirit I commend.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But this, this pierces to my marrow! Still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our shared pursuits by fountain, grove, and hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our vowed friendship to thy wishes win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My else-sealed lips;&mdash;yet, how shall I begin?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul, my brain, with clouds is overcast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At but the mere remembrance of the past&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The alarm, the mortal wound, the sudden pain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From anguish and from life; and thus, dear friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the commencement to the fatal end,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Led me to love, nor, oft as others aim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flattering fancies did I feed the flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from my tenderest infancy, perforce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some fatal star inclined me to its course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know'st a maiden, beautiful and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my own ancestors remotely sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span><span class="i0">Lovelier than Love himself; in infancy<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Amidst them, skilled the sylvan war to wage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She passed the rosy April of her age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, who from night till morning, and from morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till night, to challenge of the sprightly horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed the inspiring chase without fatigue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came by degrees in such familiar league<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her, by like pursuits and tastes allied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not stir an instant from her side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hour after hour this union stricter grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined with emotions precious, pure, and new:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What tangled mountain has been left untraced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By our swift feet? What heath, or leafy waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of forests, has not heard our hunting cry?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What babbling echo not been tired thereby?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever with liberal hands, when ceased our toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the chaste patron who decreed our spoils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heaped the holy altars, talking o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past risks, now offering of the grisly boar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grim and tusked head, and nailing now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stag's proud antlers on the sacred bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some tall pine; and thus when evening burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grateful, happy hearts, we home returned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when we shared the quarry, never went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From us one word or look of discontent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunting of all kinds charmed, but that the most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of simple birds, snared ever with least cost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of toil; and when desired Aurora showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rosy cheeks, and locks like gold that glowed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Away we passed to unfrequented bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the most secret valley we could find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut from the tread and talk of humankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, binding to two lofty trees, unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our tinctured webs of very perfect green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our voices hushed, our steps as midnight still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We netted off the vale from hill to hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, fetching a small compass, by degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We turned toward the snares, and shook the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stormed the shadiest nooks with shout and sling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the whole wood was rustling on the wing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blackbirds, larks, goldfinches, before us flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distracted, scared, not knowing what to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shunned the less, the greater evil met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusedly taken in the painted net;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curious then it was to hear them speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their griefs with doleful cry and piercing shriek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some&mdash;for the swarms were countless&mdash;you might see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fluttering their wings and striving to get free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst others, far from showing signs of rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dumb affliction drooped about the cage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, drawing tight the cords, proud of the prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne at our backs, we took our homeward way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when moist autumn came, and yellow fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild-wood leaves round bowerless Philomel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When August heats were past, a different sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no less idle, we were wont to court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass the day with joy; then, well you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black clouds of starlings circle to and fro:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span><span class="i0">Mark now the craft that we employed to snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These birds that go through unobstructed air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One straggler first from their vast companies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alive we captured, which was done with ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next, to its foot a long limed thread we tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the passing squadron we descried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft we tossed it; instantly it mixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst the rest, and our success was fixed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon, as many as the tangling string,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by the head, or leg, or neck, or wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In its a&euml;rial voyage twined around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flagged in their strength, and fell towards the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not without long strugglings in their flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much to their mischief, and to our delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Useless to it was the prophetic croak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the black rook in the umbrageous oak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one of them alive, as oft occurred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell in our hands, we made the captive bird<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where flocks of rooks in company resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our prize we took, and instant to the sport.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the extreme points of its wings, to ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But without breaking them, the bird we bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then followed what you scarce conceive; it stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes turned upward, in the attitude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one that contemplates the stars; from sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile we drew, when, frantic with affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pierced the air with loud, distressful cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summoned down its brethren from the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span><span class="i0">Instant a swift swarm which no tongue could name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew to its aid, and round it stalking came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One, of its fellow's doom more piteous grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than cautious or considerate of its own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew close&mdash;and on the first exertion made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With death or sad captivity it paid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For its simplicity; the pinioned rook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fast clung to it with the grappling-hook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its strong claws, that without special leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It could not part: now you may well conceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What our amusement was to see the twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to break loose and this fresh aid to gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrestling engage; the quarrel did not cool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till finished by our hand, and the poor fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was left at mournful leisure to repent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the vain help its thoughtless pity lent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What would'st thou say, if, standing centinel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With upraised leg when midnight shadows fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crane was snared betwixt us? Of no use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was its sagacious caution to the goose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or its perpetual fame for second-sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the snares and stratagems of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought could its strength or sleight at swimming save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white swan, dwelling on the pathless wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest it by fire, like Pha&euml;ton, should die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whom its shrill voice yet upbraids the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, sad partridge, think'st thou that to flee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight from the copse secures thy life to thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fall is in the stubble! On no bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No beast, had nature for defence conferred<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><span class="i0">Such cunning, but that by the net or shaft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fell, subdued by our superior craft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But were I each particular to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this delightful life, the vesper bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would sound ere it was done: enough to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this fond friendship, this divine-faced foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pure from passion, undisturbed by fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To different colour changed my rising years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My ill star shone; the spirit of unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love, excessive love, my soul possessed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So deep, so absolute, I no more knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, but doubted if the change were true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first I felt to mingle with the stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sweet sensations in beholding her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearful desires that on their ardent wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised me to hope impracticable things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pain for her absence was not now a pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor even an anguish brooding in the brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But torment keen as death&mdash;the ceaseless smart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fire close raging in the naked heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this sad pass I gradually was brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By my ill star, and ne'er could I have thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its baneful power reached farther, were it not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proved but too surely by my present lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, when compared with these, my former woes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might be considered as a sweet repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here 'tis fit the hated tale that swells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul with grief, and thrills the tongue that tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should find a close, nor sadden, though it sears<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And you, the Dryads of this leafy grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er you be, attend my tale of love!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have already told the prosperous part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if in peace I could have fixed my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How happy had I been; but the desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The constant striving to conceal my fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her, alas! whose sweet and gentle breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fanned it, brought me to the gates of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand times she begged, implored to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What secret something vexed my spirit so;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my pale aspect she too plainly read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief of some sort, and gaiety was fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus would she say, thus sue to me, but sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tears of anguish were my sole replies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One afternoon, returning from the chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fatigued and fevered, in the sweetest place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this wide forest, even where now we sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We both resolved our toil to intermit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the branches of this beech we flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our limbs at ease, and our bent bows unstrung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus idly lying, we inspired with zest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweet, fresh spirit breathing from the west.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowers with which the mosses were inlaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rich diversity of hues displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yielded scents as various; in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lucid as glass, this clear, shrill fountain shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revealing in its depth the sands like gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth, white pebbles whence its waters rolled;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor goat, nor stag, nor hermit, nor the sound<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When with the water of the shaded pool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had assuaged our thirst, and grew more cool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, who with kind solicitude still kept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The' intent to know why I so often wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With solemn prayers adjured me to confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause or object of my sore distress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if 'twas love, not to be swayed by shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But own it such, and write the lady's name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vowing that as she always from her youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had shown me an affection full of truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So in this instance she with pure good-will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would aid my views, and prove a sister still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, who no longer could my soul contain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dared not openly the truth explain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told her that in the fountain she might read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her name whose beauty made my bosom bleed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eager mind was instant on the wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rose, she ran, and looked into the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seeing only her own face there, blushed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With maiden shame, and from the water rushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift as if touched with madness, not a look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She deigned me, but her way disdainful took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left me murmuring here, till life shall fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My rash resolve for ever to bewail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My folly I accused&mdash;all, all engrossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain reflections on the' advantage lost.<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><span class="i0">For countless hours stretched here I lay, with eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rigidly fixed upon the vacant skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as one grief in hand another brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ceaseless tear, the phantasies of thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frequent swoon, remorse for felt offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regret, despair, the senselessness of sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a benumbing consciousness of pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetual, almost, almost whirled my brain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not how I found my friends, nor what<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led my stray footsteps homeward to my cot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only know four suns had risen and past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since fasting, sleepless, motionless, aghast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had lain here; my herds too had been left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this long time, of wonted grass bereft;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The calves that lately frisked it o'er the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finding their udders no refreshment yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lowing complained to the unheeding skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woods, alone considerate of their cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebellowing loudly, gave back the lament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though condoling with their discontent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These things yet moved me not; the many&mdash;all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fact, that now upon me came to call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were frightened with my weeping; rumour led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curious wonder, numbers to my shed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds, herdsmen, pruners of the vines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anxious to serve me, with sincerest signs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pity, pleaded, prayed me to declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause of my mad grief and deep despair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched on the earth, to them my sole replies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were broken groans, fast tears, and fiery sighs;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span><span class="i0">Or if at times I spoke, one answer came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my wild lips&mdash;the same, and still the same:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Swains of the Tagus, on its flowery shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon will you sing, 'Albanio is no more!'<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fifth night came: my ill star then inspired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brain to dare what had been long desired&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shuffling off life's load, and out I rushed<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through the dusk night I hurried to descry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some lonely spot where I might fitly die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As chance would have it, my faint footsteps drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a high cliff which yet far off I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As pendant o'er the flood, scooped into caves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By constant sapping of the restless waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, as I sate beneath an elm, o'erspent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden ray returning memory lent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I once, with her, had to the neighbouring trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come at midnoon to take the cooling breeze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this my fancy fixed; the thought like balm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assuaged my frenzy, and I grew more calm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the dawn with roses had begun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pave the path of the resplendent sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the green trees bowed, and, woke from rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smiling Ocean bared her heaving breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, as the melancholy swan, that feeling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life's latest anguish o'er her spirit stealing,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span><span class="i0">Sings with her quivering bill and melting breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad, but most sweet, the lullaby to death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I, in equal pain and sickness lying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The immortal passing, and the mortal dying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took my last farewell of the skies and sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In passionate laments that thus might run:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh! fierce as Scythian bears in thy disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the howling of the stormy main<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A wretched frame fast hastening to decay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I faint&mdash;I die, and thus will put an end<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against me, to the causes of my death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give celebration and perpetual breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh wolves! oh bears! that in the deep descents<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these o'ershaded caves to my laments<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are listening now, as oft my flute could move<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Still waters, foaming streams, and you, ye strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sonorous cataracts, farewell! live long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long ages after me, and as ye sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay rich tribute to the hoary deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft sound my sad voice through the stony vales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft to the traveller tell autumnal tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him whose tuneful ditties charmed of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your living waves, rejoicing as ye rolled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who watered here his heifers, day by day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To fling myself, and clambered up the hill<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When lo! a blast sufficient to displace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The huge sierra from its stable base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose and smote me to the earth, where long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lay astonished from a stroke so strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when at length I came to recollect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the marvel seriously reflect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I blamed my impious rashness, and the crime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sought to end before the destined time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By means so terrible, my life of grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though harsh, determinate, though bitter, brief.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have since then been steadily resigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wait for death, when mercilessly kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It comes to free me from my pangs; and now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how it comes! Though heav'n did not allow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me to find death, the assassin is left free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find, and shake his fatal dart o'er me.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have now told thee the true cause, the cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Occurrence, pain, and process of my loss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulfil thy promise now, and if thou art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed my friend, as I believe, depart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor give disturbance to a grief so deep&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Know'st thou, clear mirror, what thy glass has done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven from me the delightful face of one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose kind society and faith approved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I now no less desire than then I loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not as he supposed; God grant that first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart may break, ere vowed Camilla burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The virgin band that binds her with the maids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dear Diana, and her sacred shades!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what reluctance thought renews the sense<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Exculpates me; if of his absence I<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Would live contented, and the boy forget.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These clear cool springs a lulling murmur make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here will I lie, and my sweet siesta take;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the sultry noon is over, go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again in search of my rebellious roe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still 'tis a mystery and surprise to me<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Methought, or frolic fancy must delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With false presentments to deceive my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a wood-nymph, gliding through the groves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach the near fountain; haply, if she loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She may advise me of some charm, may name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some dear deceit to ease this painful flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No given advice but aggravates my grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If 'tis in discord with my own belief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the hopeless harm can none accrue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh holy Gods! what is it that I view?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it a phantom changed into the form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her whose beauty makes my blood run warm?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, 'tis herself, Camilla, sleeping here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It must be she&mdash;her beauty makes it clear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one such wonder Nature wished to make,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But now, though certain is the bliss displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I venture to awake the maid,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My former seat beneath the shady beech,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><span class="i0">And hers is slumber deep as death; she lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How beautifully blind! the bee that flies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near her, the quarrelling birds, that old sweet tune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hummed by the spring, all voices of the noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tease, but disturb her not; her face is free&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A charming book&mdash;to be perused by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will seize the' occasion; if the boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In being parted should from slumber rouse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong to detain her I am still, though not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when we last were seated on this spot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh hands, once vigorously disposed to end me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See you how much your power can now befriend me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why not exert it for my welfare!&mdash;small<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hark then awhile, and I will tell of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange and amazing: Spirits of these springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nymphs, I invoke you! Silvans, Satyrs, Fauns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That haunt the glens, the greenwoods, and the lawns!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet from my lips let each clear accent part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All point or grace, all harmony or art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since neither pastoral pipe, Arcadian quill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor syrinx sounds in concord with my will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such rare heights Severo's powers aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chanted verse and smooth harmonious lyre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can stay fleet whirlwinds in their mid career,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His golden words and messages to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make them from austere, rebellious lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obsequious slaves to dance around his chords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In voluntary song; old Tormes knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His incantation, and, commanded, shows<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span><span class="i0">The Senior all his secrets: once he led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty master to his fountain-head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed him where mid river-flowers and fern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lies, incumbent o'er a crystal urn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this he saw a thousand things embossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreseen, and sculptured with surprising cost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With so divine a wit the sage has wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This vase, each object seems instinct with thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every side the figured bas-reliefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depict the deeds and virtues of the chiefs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who by illustrious titles dignified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruled the tract through which his waters glide.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There the brave youth, <span class="smcap">Don Garcia</span>, stood confessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his disdainful mien, dilated chest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He 'gainst a wise and potent king that held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sire in bondage, gallantly
rebelled,<a name="ENanchor_7" id="ENanchor_7"></a><a href="#Endnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each bold retainer summoning, to aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pious aims; with him the God pourtrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His son, who showed, whilst earth enjoyed his light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At court a Ph&oelig;bus, and a Mars in fight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young though he seemed, he promised in his look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supreme success in all he undertook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n in his youth, upon the Moors he dealt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severe rebukes, and made his puissance felt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the chieftain of the Christian band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confirmed his heart and exercised his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere, with more assured renown, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more of manhood on his martial brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He harassed the fierce Franks: sublime he stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sight, his armours red with hostile blood.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span><span class="i0">Long in the straitened siege had he sustained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woes of want; no measure now remained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through the breaches of the rending wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In furious sally on the foe to fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What numbers died that day beneath his spear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What other numbers fled like hunted deer!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No pictured tale, no sculptured argument,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No poet's flame could fitly represent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fierce <span class="smcap">Fadrique</span> smote them as they fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chaser's rage, and the pursued one's dread.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Near him is seen in bold relief his son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Don Garcia</span>, equalled upon earth by none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless by his Fernando! who could view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ardent light of his dear beauty, who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The expression of his frank fair countenance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor own his grandeur in that single glance?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! in cruelty the Furies hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War's fires abroad, and snatched him from the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world so happy in his light! sad Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy weeping eyes how oft didst thou in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll toward Gelves! Acting his sad part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth is sculptured with such lively art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That should you see it, you would say each stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was fraught with life, and that the crystal spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad sands burned, the sun of bloody red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soldiers round him fell down faint or dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With earnest vigilance he only cursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dull delay, and reckless as at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praised glorious death; when suddenly the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Illa Allah shook the skies, the ground<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span><span class="i0">Rang with strong trampling, and a dusty host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fierce barbarians the young chief enclosed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he, nought daunted, cast to them his gage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In generous frenzy of audacious rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore up bravely, making many pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The price of their temerity; these lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In deep disorder, some whose vital threads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had already slit, with cloven heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wallowing in blood; some silent dying; some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet breathing free, not wholly overcome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed palpitating bowels, strangely gored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the deep gashes given by his sharp sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Fate was in the conflict, and at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deaf with the din, his spirits failing fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced through with thousand swords, and craving grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his sins, he laid his pallid face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the burnt soil, and sighed away, forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His soul of beauty like the rose of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That smit by the hot season, sickening grieves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs its gay head, and pales its crimson leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as a lily which the passing share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves cruelly cut down, whereby its fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transparent hue, though not all perished, now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That its maternal earth neglects to throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Juice through its veins, fades soon as noontide tells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wonted rosary on its dewy bells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So on the mimic sands, in miniature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shows thy fair face, fresh rose, white lily pure!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Next a strange sculpture draws and so detains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The' observer's notice, that he entertains<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span><span class="i0">No curiosity aught else to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wild soe'er, or beautiful, or new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The three sweet Graces there are seen pourtrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Phidian skill, transparently arrayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One only garment of celestial white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veils their soft limbs, but shuts not out the sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn are they cheering, strengthening for the throe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noble lady in her hour of woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon the dear infant is seen born; ne'er smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ripening moon upon a lovelier child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his little cradle, overspread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flowers, the name of <span class="smcap">Don Fernando's</span> read.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From sweetly singing on the shady crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pindus, the Nine Lights of life come down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with them Ph&oelig;bus, rosy and unshorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes, like the moon amidst the stars of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With graceful step; arriving, they confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His charms, and long and tenderly caress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere winged Mercury is drawn beholding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mars, the plumed warrior, cautiously enfolding<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new-born infant in his rude embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon giving courteous and respectful place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Venus, smiling at his side; in turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She kissed his cheek, and from a golden urn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprinkled Elysian nectar o'er the boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lavish hand, and fond familiar joy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Ph&oelig;bus from her arms the child displaced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave the office to his sisters chaste.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They were delighted with the sweet employ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time waves his wings, the babe becomes a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span><span class="i0">Rising and flourishing in youthful grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a tall poplar in a shady place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talents he showed untaught, and undisguised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave now such proofs of genius, as surprised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The associate nymphs, and they the boy consigned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one of blameless life and cultured mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who to the world might make more manifest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich endowments which the child possessed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient man, whose face, ungiven to guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expressed severeness sweetening to a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received the youth; Severo, when his gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on this form, stood spell-bound with amaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as within a looking-glass he viewed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself depicted, air, age, attitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All were conformable, just so he trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So looked, so greeted; turning to the god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw him smiling at his frank surprise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And why this so great wonder?" Tormes cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Seem I so ignorant as not to' have known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere to thy yearning mother thou wert shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wouldst be, when future suns should shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wise Director of his soul divine?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ancient, with deep joy of wonder bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eager eyes upon the picture fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Next, as his looks along the sculptures glanced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A youth with Ph&oelig;bus hand in hand advanced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courteous his air, from his ingenuous face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Informed with wisdom, modesty, and grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every mild affection, at a scan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passer-by would mark him for a man,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span><span class="i0">Perfect in all gentilities of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sweeten life and harmonize mankind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The form which lively thus the sculptor drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assur'd Severo in an instant knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him who had by careful culture shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fernando's spirit lovely as his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had given him grace, sincerity, and ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pure politeness that aspires to please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The candid virtues that disdain pretence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And martial manliness, and sprightly sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the generous courtesies enshrined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the fair temple of Fernando's mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When well surveyed, his name Severo read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Bosc&aacute;n!</span>!" whose genius o'er the world is spread:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whose illumined aspect shines the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, streamed from Delphos, lights him to the lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warms those songs which with mankind shall stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst endless ages roll unfelt away!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More ripeness marked the youth, as to his rules<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening, he culled the learning of the schools;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These left at length, he in gymnastic games,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War's mimic symbols, strives with youths, whose names<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had never else been known to after years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the wide world; the tilt of canes and spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrestling, the course, the circus, toil and dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave his arm skill, and made his limbs robust.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Next, amorous Venus shows her rosy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seizing his hand, she leads him for a space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the severe gymnasium, and aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Points out his fault with all a lecturer's pride;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span><span class="i0">Tells him how ill he acts; that some few hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roughest soldier wreathes his sword with flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that in endless turmoil so to waste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The May of life was treason to good taste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering a myrtle bower, she shows him, laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midst leaves and violets blue, a slumbering maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushed was her cheek, and as she slept she smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some delightful dream her brain beguiled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, the crimsoning cheek his passion spoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bowers they rustled, and the nymph awoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smit with her beauty, he desired to wed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The enchanting shape&mdash;the Goddess shook her head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if she feared the parties to unite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gazed&mdash;he gazed, insatiate with the sight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her dear side he could not, could not move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wept on her neck, and vowed eternal love.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Next, angry Mars, imperious to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing, gave the youth a crown of gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threatening the illustrious youth, a knight was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a fierce spirit and insulting
mien.<a name="ENanchor_8" id="ENanchor_8"></a><a href="#Endnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cautious wise beneath the setting moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They timed their steps, and met on a pontoon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well had the sculptor shadowed out the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His clouding crystal spoke the noon of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mars was their umpire; he condemned the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed his crown upon the conqueror's brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Graced with the gold, the hero shone from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in blue heaven the beautiful bright star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ushers in Aurora: thence his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreads to all parts, and gathers greater fame.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span><span class="i2">Soon other happier arts he meditates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To steal from death, elusive of the Fates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much of himself, and live admired, unfled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the blind vulgar might lament him dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hymen came moving to the crotal's clash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His right foot sandalled with a golden sash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A choir of virgins sing; on dancing feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They part alternate, and alternate meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then softly lay upon the bridal couch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blushing girl, whom Venus did avouch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be the same that, bowered in myrtles deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erst smiled so sweetly in her dreaming sleep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dream as sweetly realized! she showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worthy the youth on whom she was bestowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pillow bore the words, impaled in flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Donna Maria Enr&iacute;quez</span>, her name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anxious to be admitted, scarce the choir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nymphs could check Fernando's forward fire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he was received, and left beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His virtuous, pure, and beautiful young bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Elsewhere, on one foot standing, never stable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Capricious Fortune did the sculptor fable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calling to Don Fernando that he led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A life of idleness, and now must tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A toilsome path, but she would be his guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And venture first: he with her wish complied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made her his boon companion, and pursued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her who, unveiled, as beautiful is wooed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, veiled from sight, deemed fearful, nothing worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue her name, the rarity of earth!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><span class="i2">Whom does she guide along with equal pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But him whom thus her beauty leads to face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each fresh fatigue, for glory to aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scorn the chains of delicate desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty Pyrenees, which seem to shoot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven their summit as to hell their root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They traversed in mid-winter; white the snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Colours the clime, and mute the torrents flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under cold crystal bridges that confine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tides, smooth sliding through the frozen mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst, if a blast but stirs the pines, they bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the weight of ices crashing rend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all they strive, nor will be held at bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by the length or wildness of the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By constant toil the hero makes advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the gained summit shifts the scene to France;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His swiftness Fame renewed&mdash;his spirits cheered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On flying wings beside him she appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And signified, in act and attitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the hill-tracks would soon become less rude.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of various guides the Duke selected one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on they rode beneath the mounting sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint wax their horses, but they reached at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls of Paris, and its portals passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the gaunt form of Sickness stands to sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The healthy duke assisting to alight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched by her hand, his colour seems to fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He droops, he faints, and sickens to a shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon, crossing from a shady thicket green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The form of Esculapius might be seen<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span><span class="i0">With balms and herbs, nor did he slack his tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he arrived beside Fernando's bed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his right foot he entered, and at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restored the patient to his usual strength.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His way he took where white-wall'd convents shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reached the passage of the lucid Rhine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich romantic river on its breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received him, glorying in so great a guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called to mind the hour when to the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embarking point the Latin C&aelig;sar came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed not scanty of his waves, but swelled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which flying left behind green viny bowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High castled crags, and old romantic towers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blythely his impulse the swift bark obeyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed the spot where erst a ravished maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thousand virgins with her, stained the sod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blood, recorded in the book of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The espoused pure virgin, Ursula, was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Casting her dying eyes to heaven serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant looking on, who, at a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From breast to beauteous breast the sword transferred.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thence through wide Germany he shaped his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where in doubt the Christian army lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till to his sight the rapid Danube gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His affluent floods; he launched upon the wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the spurned shore the refluent currents strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winged through cleft crags his bounding boat along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the strained oars with forcible descent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised showers of silver wheresoe'er it went:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">War had convoked the magnates of the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst his peers and princes Charles was placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Spanish C&aelig;sar, and the duke embraced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charmed with his coming; all in pleased surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on Fernando their saluting eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the same instant they perceived him, grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure of the victory when the trumpet blew.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With much vain-glory, haughtiness of mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And barbarous boasting, the Grand Turk was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed, and in rich costume; pitched far and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near weeping Hungary was his camp descried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strange a multitude o'erspread the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scarce the region could the host contain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A host so vast, the country, you would think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would fail for pasture, and the stream for drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">C&aelig;sar, with pious zeal and valiant soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These hosts despised, and bade his flags unrol;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tribes convoked, and shortly you might see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An army form&mdash;bold, resolute, and free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See various nations in one camp combined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Various in speech, but influenced by one mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They swarmed not o'er the land in such parade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of numbers as the Moslem, but displayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which these failed to show&mdash;a brave freewill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faith, courage, firmness, discipline, and skill.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span><span class="i0">Them with a generous zeal, by apt applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fernando heartens in the common cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That numbers of them in his views took part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won to his flag with admirable art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fierce yet docile German he addressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own style, and so to all the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conformed in custom, humour, mood, and tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave with the age'd and sprightly with the young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the phlegmatic Fleming would have said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And closed her long, long warfare in the fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rival Carthage and grim Hannibal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose crimson sword, to Nemesis devote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So oft was pointed at her naked throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Next sickening Envy on the crystal stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severely sculptured, adverse to his good,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With them she armed, but in all points, with pain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He with mild tongue and with extended hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tumult hushed of the censorious bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by degrees soared with so high a flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eyes of Envy could not reach his height,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span><span class="i0">So that successless, blinded by the blaze<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And forces her proud self, in suppliant weed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On earth to kneel, and for forgiveness plead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monster's spoils he carelessly received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, from these rude anxieties relieved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked in the cool serene of eve beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lonely stream, and near its tossing tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encountered C&aelig;sar, full of doubt and care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the success of the approaching war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, though he banished sadness, still the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the vast stake he ventured, with it brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wish for wise counsel; this the duke bestowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They there agreed on a convenient mode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To' obstruct the plans of Solyman, destroy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His high-raised hopes, and blast his promised joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their counsels ended, weary they repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the green turf, and as their eyelids close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear the dim Danube's voice, so it might seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmur approval of their golden scheme.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the pausing eye the chisel gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clear stream's Genius issuing from the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aged, on tiptoe moving mute, with reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And willows crowned, and robed in sea-green weeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He in that sleep uncertain showed them clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that concerned their ends; it would appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this sweet idlesse crossed their good, for swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As though some precious gem or cherished gift<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hope to the heart, and gladness to the mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stream without delay appeared to urge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chiefs aboard, and smoothed its eddying surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Armada which it had to guide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er its broad waters might more gently glide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What favour to the fleets its Genius bore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Scarce in the forge at which the Cyclops sweat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mimicked the moving waters; on the coast<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The other host, affrighted at the view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From tent to tent in wild distraction flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager to gather from the public breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The' unknown intelligence of life or death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a vast stream by wintry breezes crost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through bones and marrow ran an icy frost,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His hopes of safety in immediate haste.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The camp is raised in tumult; on their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They march, they speed in shameful disarray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving behind in terror, unconcealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gold and jewels strewed o'er all the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tents wherein sloth, murder, revelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rape, found place with each unholy thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They part without; armed steeds run masterless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their scared lords the scared dependants press;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the fierce Spaniard, hovering round their rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strains the red sword, and shakes the lifted spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">C&aelig;sar is seen attempting to restrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fernando, ardent above all to stain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sword in unbelieving blood; with bold<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Without alighting, ever with his heel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking his courser, treads in sweet Castile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To home's near joys&mdash;his lady's wished embrace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What to the mind or eye obscure remained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The courteous River lucidly explained.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now thou hast all foreseen, go forth&mdash;the Urn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To its accustomed place I must return."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Yet first," Severo said, "to me unfold<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span><span class="i0">Which glitters on the shaded crystal bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a red comet in the noon of night?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"More knowledge, friend, than Heav'n metes out to man,"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If I not clearly picture that which draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy notice thus, thou art thyself the cause;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whilst a veil of flesh your spirit shrouds,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Senior by the hand Severo shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh wonderful! the waves where the sun sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were on each side restricted in a rank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, deep albeit before, did now disclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bed between them, and as high they rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepening the part near which the prophet stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave a spring, and leaped into the flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White flew the foam to heaven, and loud to land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roared the stirred waters mixed with golden sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In a new science versed, Severo grey<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Its fruits for future hope, and unbesought<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And though he well might judge my mind would fail<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet not for this did he refuse to' unrol<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my survey the strange prophetic scroll;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Some of their toils the promised fruits to claim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some who make virtue both the end and aim<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of action, or would have the world suppose<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To strive for much more silver than may serve<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To lift me gracefully from each extreme<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of thrifty meanness, thriftless pride; I deem<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The men contemptible that stoop to use<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The one or other, that delight to seem<br /></span>

<span class="i2">My wandering course; and prosecute at last<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My purpose, whither thou must know the past<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has ever led, and where the present still<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leads Garcilasso: on the green turf cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here, midst the woods of this stupendous hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On various things I brood, not unperplexed by ill.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Vary my life, and waste the summer noon;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus pass my hours beguiled; but out of tune<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Kindled by love, and o'er the smouldering pyre<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of passion coldness creeps: I only wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This one result; the love that would expire<br /></span>

<h3>EPISTLE TO BOSC&Aacute;N.</h3>


<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who loves like me for his friend's eye to frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughts even on things that have no Spanish name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can never want materials for his sheet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in a style brief, simple, easy, neat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chaste in ornament, as best befits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chitchat writing of familiar wits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the' advantage which with other things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To minds like ours perfected friendship brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this same careless freedom which one gains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the nice pomp of ceremonial chains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus free, thus easy, I proceed to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the first place, that I'm arrived&mdash;and well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one can be, who in a time so brief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has rid the distance noted over-leaf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A looser rein I give, as I proceed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my winged fancy than my trotting steed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times it bears me onward by a way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So smooth and pleasant, with a step so gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As makes me quite forget my past fatigues;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times o'er ruts so rough, by such long leagues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in the present pain I lose no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vexing thought of undergone distress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But times there are again, when I create<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A middle course, both temperate and sedate,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span><span class="i0">When taste and temper, scene and season suit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the ingenious thought and nice dispute.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus as I musing rode one day, and thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his endowments who so well has taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paths to friendship,<a name="FNanchor_AR_44" id="FNanchor_AR_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_AR_44" class="fnanchor">[AR]</a> almost instantly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My thoughts, beloved Bosc&aacute;n, recurred to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feelings rose, which singular appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least to me, which therefore thou shalt hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst much reflecting on the sacred tie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our affection which I hold so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The' exchange of talent, taste, intelligence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shared gifts and multiplied delights which thence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refresh our souls in their perpetual flow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There nothing is that makes me value so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetness of this compact of the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the affection on my own warm part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such force it has, that (not disparaging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other pleasures that from friendship spring)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aid&mdash;the advantage each to each has dealt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this alone my soul has seemed to melt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I well know that I am otherwise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Influenced in this than by the joys that rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From things as useful; seeing then the' effect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strong within me, led me to reflect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And search into the cause; I have thus traced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure, profit, ornament, and taste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the blest chain of love to me imparts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The chain some Angel tangled round our hearts)<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span><span class="i0">To their true source, as things that do not mount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From me, but tell alone to my account;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But love itself (whence all things may have birth)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it is seen to furnish aught of worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, dear friend, joy, taste, or benefit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the grand reason of my valuing it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above all selfish interests, as it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More godlike to bestow imparted bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to receive it; thus the loving makes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My good&mdash;a good that of no ill partakes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such were my thoughts. But oh, how shall I set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fully to view my shame and my regret,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For having praised so at a single glance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roads, the dealings, and hotels of France!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shame&mdash;that with reason now thou may'st pronounce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself a fabler, and my praise a bounce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regret&mdash;my time so much to have misused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In rashly lauding what were best abused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here, all fibs apart, you find but jades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hacks, sour wines, and pilfering chambermaids,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long ways, long bills, no silver, fleecing hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the luxury of lumbering posts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving too from Naples by the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naples,&mdash;the choice, the brilliant, and the gay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I left no treasure buried there, except<br /></span>

<p>"The king fortified his camp according to the rules of art,
and in a single night a town was built, consisting of four
streets in the form of a cross, with as many gates; and from
the centre, where the streets crossed each other, all the town
might be viewed at the same time. The plan was undertaken
and completed by four Grandees of Castile, every one furnishing
his share, and the whole was encircled with wooden
bulwarks covered with waxen cloth, which resembled a
strong wall. Towers and bastions were also fabricated, to
appear as if built by regular machinery. In the morning,
the Moors were prodigiously astonished to see a town so near
Granada, fortified in so formidable a manner. When it was
finished, the king granted it the rights of a city, naming it
Santa F&eacute;, and endowed it with many privileges, which it enjoys
to the present day. It is recorded in the next ballad:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The king, and the queen, and all the court, were, as the
ballad says, most astonished at this valiant deed of Garcilasso,
and the king commanded him to place on his arms the words
<span class="smcap">Ave Maria</span>, with just reason, for having quitted himself
so well upon that ruffian Moor, and for having cut off his
head."&mdash;<i>Hist. de las Guerras Civiles de Granada</i>, fol. 454-9.</p>

<p>A manuscript in the Bodleian Library&mdash;of <i>Rawlinson's
Collection, No.</i> 43,&mdash;says that Garcilasso, at the time this
combat took place, was but eighteen years of age. The
manuscript bears this title, 'Armas de los mas nobles Se&ntilde;ores
de Castilla, sus nombres, apellidos, casas y rentas; con algunos
puntos de sus haza&ntilde;as; los Arcobispos, Obispos, Visoreyes y
Embaxadores, Consejos y Inquisiciones, y otras cosas curiosas
de aquel Reyno: en Paris, y compuesto por Ambrosio de
Salazar, Secretario Interprete del Rey Cristianissimo. 1623.'
This writer, however, follows the general error of imputing the
action to the father of the poet. His account of the family
arms differs also from Imhof's: according to his account, they
bear, <i>or</i>, a castle on a field <i>vert</i>, with the words <span class="smcap">Ave Maria,
Gracia Plena</span>, in letters <i>azure</i>: but as this association of
tinct would be false heraldry, it has seemed preferable to follow
the authority of Imhof. It may not be amiss to mention
in this place, that although Garcilasso is said to have been
dignified with the cross of the Order of St. James, the badge
represented in paintings of him is that of the Order of
Alcantara.</p>

<p>The volume of Navagero's writings being but rarely met with,
and his poetical compositions exhibiting much delicacy of
thought and elegance of style, I shall perhaps be doing an
acceptable thing in presenting to the reader a few of his
smaller verses. His longer pieces, the pastoral entitled 'Iolas,'
the sapphics 'In Auroram,' and the lines 'In Vancium vicum
Patavinum am&aelig;nissimum,' are perhaps yet more beautiful in
imagery than those I have selected; but short as these are,
they may serve to show the grounds which his cotemporaries
had for the praises they bestowed upon him.</p>

GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA TO THE VERY MAGNIFICENT LADY, THE
LADY GERONYMA PALOVA DE ALMOGAVAR.</h3>

<p>If I had not already known the correctness of your ladyship's
judgment, the value which I see you set upon this
work would suffice to assure me of it. But you already
stood so high in my opinion, that though I before considered
it excellent on many accounts, my principal reason now for
this consideration is, that you have set your stamp on it in
such a manner, that we might almost say it was your own work,
as it is through you we possess it in the language we best
understand. For, so far from thinking of being able to prevail
on Bosc&aacute;n to translate it, I should not even have dared
to ask it of him, well knowing his constant dislike to the
writers of romances, (though this he could scarcely call a
romance) had I not assured myself that, being commanded by
your ladyship, he could not excuse himself. With myself
I am extremely well satisfied, as before the book reached
your hands, I esteemed it as it deserves; whereas had I only
become acquainted with its merits, now that I see you deem
them great, I might imagine that I was influenced in my
judgment of it by your ladyship's opinion. But now, I not
merely suspect, but am convinced it is a book that deserves
to be commended to your hands, that it may afterwards
without danger go forth into the world. For it is a most
necessary thing wherever there are gentlemen and ladies of
distinction, that they should not only consult whatsoever serves
to increase the point of honour, but guard against every
thing that has a tendency to lessen it: both the one and the
other are treated of in this performance with so much wisdom
and address, that it seems to me there is nothing more
to be wished for than to see the whole realized in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
gentleman, and likewise in&mdash;I was going to say, some lady,
but I recollected that you were in the world to take me to
account for the idle words. We may moreover remark on
this work of Castiglione, that as highly successful performances
always go beyond their promise, so the Count has laid down
the duties of a finished courtier with such absolute completeness
as not to leave one of any rank unacquainted with what
he ought to do and be. So that we may see how much we
should have lost in not possessing it. Nor must we pass over
the very essential benefit rendered to our language by having
written in it things so deserving of perusal; for I know not
what misfortune has ever been ours, in scarcely possessing an
author that has written in Castilian any thing but what might
very well be dispensed with,&mdash;though this indeed would be difficult
to prove to the satisfaction of those who pore over the
volumes which instruct mankind in slaughter. And well did
your ladyship know what person to fix upon to be your
medium in producing this benefit to all. For notwithstanding
it is as difficult a matter, in my judgment, to translate a book
well, as to write it in the first instance, so admirably has
Bosc&aacute;n performed his part, that every time I sit down to read
this work of his, or, to speak more accurately, of yours, it
seems to me to have been written in no other language. Or if
at any time I remember to have read the Italian, my thoughts
immediately return to the pages in my hands. One thing he
has guarded against, which very few have done; he has
avoided affectation without incurring the sin of stiffness, and
with great purity of style has made use of expressions especially
polite and agreeable to refined ears, and of words neither
novel in appearance, nor disused amongst the people: he has
proved himself also a very faithful translator, and by not
restricting himself to the rigour of the letter, but to the truth
and spirit of the thoughts, has transfused in his version by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
variety of ways, all the force and ornament of the original.
He has thus given every thing so much in the manner of his
author, and has found his author such, that the defenders of
the work may with little trouble answer those who wish in
any respect to carp at its contents. I do not address myself
to men whose dainty ears, amidst a thousand elegant things
contained in the volume, are offended with one or two that
may not be quite so good as the rest, being inclined to think
that these one or two are the only points that please them,
whilst they are offended with all the rest; and this I could
prove, if I were inclined, by what they approve in other
cases.</p>

<p>We are not, however, to lose time with these captious
geniuses, but referring them to him who himself answers
them on these very points, let us turn to those who with some
show of reason might desire satisfaction in what offends them,
where the author treats of all the numerous methods of
saying genteel things, and smart repartees to excite mirth.
Some there are given as specimens, which do not appear
to reach the excellence of others, nor deserve perhaps to be
considered as very good for one who has so admirably treated
of the rest; and hence they may suspect that he has not the
great judgment and penetration we ascribe to him. To this
we would answer, that the author's intention was to furnish a
variety of modes of saying graceful things, and hence, that we
might better know the difference between them, he gave
an equal variety of examples: in discoursing on all these
many ways, there could not possibly be so many clever
flights in each; some of those therefore which he gave for
examples, of necessity fall short of the merit of others,
and such, I have good reason to believe, without deceiving
himself in the least as to their inferiority, an author of
his good sense considers them; so we see that in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
respect also he is free from blame. I only must plead guilty
and deserving of censure, for having been so tedious in my
communication. But these impertinences really make me
angry, and compel me to write so long a letter to so faultless a
personage. I frankly confess that I so greatly envied you
the thanks that are your due in the production of this book,
that I wished, so far as I could, to have myself some
concern in it, and for fear any one should employ himself in
translating, that is to say, in spoiling the original, I earnestly
entreated Bosc&aacute;n to print his own version without delay,
in order to stop the hurry which those who write ill are
accustomed to use in inflicting their performances on the
public. And although this translation would give me revenge
sufficient on any other that might be put forth, I am such
a foe to contention, that even this, though attended with no
possible danger, would yet annoy me. For this reason,
almost by force, I made him put it to press with all expedition,
and he chose to have me with him at the final polish,
but rather as a mere man of sense than as his assistant in
any emendation. Of your ladyship, I beg that as his book is
under your protection, it may lose nothing for the little part
I take in it, since in return for this act of goodness, I
now lay it at your feet, written in a better character, wherein
your name and accomplishments may be read and admired
of all.</p>

PETRUS BEMBUS GARCILASSO HISPANO, S. P. D.</h3>

<p class="right"><i>Neapolim.</i></p>

<p>Ex iis carminibus qu&aelig; ad me pridem scripsisti, et quantum
me amares, libentissim&egrave; perspexi, qui neque familiarem tibi
hominem, neque de facie cognitum tam honorific&egrave; appellavisses,
tantisque ornares laudibus; et quantus ipse esses in lyricis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
pangendis, quant&uacute;mque pr&aelig;stares ingenii luminibus amabil&iacute;tat&eacute;que
scribendi, facil&egrave; cognovi. Quorum alterum ejusmodi
est, ut nihil mihi potuerit accidere jucundius. Quid est enim
quod possit cum pr&aelig;stantissimi poet&aelig; amore atque benevolenti&acirc;
comparari? Reliqua enim omnia, qu&aelig; et honesta et chara
homines habent, un&agrave; cum iis qui ea possident, brevi tempore
intereunt: Poet&aelig; uni vivunt, long&aelig;vique ac diuturni sunt,
eand&eacute;mque vitam ac diuturnitatem, quibus volunt, impartiuntur.
In altero illud perfecisti, ut non sol&ugrave;m Hispanos tuos
omneis, qui se Apollini Musisque dediderunt, long&egrave; numeris
superes et pr&aelig;curras tuis, sed Italis etiam hominibus stimulum
addas, quo magis magisque se excitent, si mod&ograve; volent in
hoc abs te certamine atque his in studiis ipsi quoque non
pr&aelig;teriri. Quem quidem meum de te sensum atque judicium,
alia tua nonnulla ejusdem generis mihi Neapoli nuper missa
scripta confirmaverunt. Nihil enim legi fer&egrave; h&acirc;c &aelig;tate confectum
aut elegantius, aut omnino probius et purius, aut cert&egrave;
majori cum dignitate. Itaque quod me amas, mihi verissim&egrave;
justissim&egrave;que l&aelig;tor; quod egregius es vir atque magnus, c&ugrave;m
tibi in primis gratulor, tum ver&ograve; plurimum terr&aelig; Hispani&aelig;,
patri&aelig; atque altrici tu&aelig;, cui quidem est hoc nomine amplissimus
bon&aelig; laudis atque glori&aelig; cumulus accessurus. Tametsi
est etiam aliud, quod quidem auget magnopere l&aelig;titiam ex te
conceptam meam. Nam c&ugrave;m nuper mecum Honoratus
monachus, quem tibi fam&acirc; notum esse video, in eum sermonem
esset ingressus, ut quid de tuis carminibus sentirem, me interrogavisset,
ego ver&ograve; illi meum judicium patefecissem, quod
quidem accidit ei par, atque simillimum suo, (est autem
peracri vir ingenio atque in poeticis studiis pererudito) ea mihi
de tuis plurimis maximisque virtutibus, de morum suavitate,
de integritate vit&aelig;, de humanitate tu&acirc; dixit, qu&aelig; amici ei sui
per literas significavissent, ut hoc adderet, omnium Neapolitanorum
qui te novissent, sermonibus attestationibusque
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>firmari, his temporibus, quibus maxim&egrave; Italiam vestr&aelig; nationes
referserunt, quem omnes plan&egrave; homines te uno ardentius amaverint,
cuique plus tribuerint, illam ad urbem ex Hispani&acirc; venisse
porr&ograve; nullum. Quamobrem magnum me fecisse lucrum statuo,
qui nullo meo labore in tuam benevolentiam pervenerim, tuque
ita me complexus sis, ut etiam ornes Mus&aelig; tu&aelig; pr&aelig;conio tam
illustri. Quibus quidem fit rebus, ut nisi te contr&agrave; ipse quamplurim&ugrave;m
et amavero et coluero, hominem profect&ograve; esse me
nequaquam putem. Sed amoris erga te mei atque observanti&aelig;
studium, testatum tibi facere hoc ab initio decrevi, ut eundem
Honoratum, de quo supr&agrave; commemoravi, qui te impens&egrave; diligit,
ad teque in pr&aelig;senti&acirc; proficiscitur, summ&acirc; tibi diligenti&acirc;
commendarem. Ut hinc potissim&ugrave;m cognosceres, quid de me
tibi ipse polliceri possis, c&ugrave;m me videas id abs te audere
petere, quod mihi esse maximum maxim&egrave;que expetendum
statuissem. Illius fratrum, hominum innocentium et plan&egrave;
bonorum patrimonium, quemadmodum null&acirc; ipsorum culp&acirc;, in
Gallici belli pr&aelig;da fuerit, scire te arbitror; itaque de eo nihil
dicam. Nunc autem c&ugrave;m hi ab Carolo Imperatore, omnium
qui unquam nati sunt, regum atque principum optimo, injust&egrave;
amissa repetere statuerint, si te unum ejus rei adjutorem
habebunt, sperant se, quod honest&egrave; cupiunt, etiam facil&egrave;
consequi posse; ea tua est et apud Imperatorem ipsum gratia,
et apud illos, qui ei charissimi sunt, autoritas, familiaritas,
necessitudo. Quare magnopere te rogo, ut rem suscipias,
fratresque illos atque familiam in pristinum fortun&aelig; statum
tu&acirc; cur&acirc; procurationeque restituas. Homines honestissimos
tuique studiosissimos tibi in perpetuum devincies; mihi ver&ograve;
tam gratum feceris, ut illo ipso patrimonio me abs te iri auctum
et ornatum putem. Honoratum enim tam diligo, qu&agrave;m si
mens esset frater; tanti facio, ut &aelig;qu&egrave; perpaucos; tam illi
cupio h&acirc;c in re tuo beneficio et usui et voluptati esse, ut ipse,
cujus fratrum interest, magis idem cupere non possit, aut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
magis animo laborare, qu&agrave;m ipse plan&egrave; laboro. Sed hunc
laborem meum tu, qui me tu&acirc; sponte diligis, dexteritate ill&acirc;
tu&acirc;, qu&acirc; excellis, et ingenio, quo te charum et peramabilem
apud omnes homines reddis, mihi, ut spero, celeriter eripies.
Quod ut facias, natur&aelig; bonitati ac lenitati confisus tu&aelig;, non
jam ut novus tibi amicus pudenter atque subtimid&egrave;, sed quemadmodum
veteres necessarii solent, etiam atque etiam abs te

</div></div></div>

<p>During one of the many tumults that distracted Castile
in the reign of king D. Juan II. Fernando Alvarez de Toledo,
earl of Alva, was seized by the monarch, and kept close
prisoner, under the charge of having designed to bring in
the king of Navarre, though this the people regarded as a
mere invention. Don Garcia, his son, who was afterwards
the first duke of Alva, took up arms to liberate his father,
joined the king of Arragon, and from the castle of Piedrahita,
did much harm to the king of Castile in laying waste the
frontier country. Don Fernando remained, however, in
prison till the accession of king Henry, when he was
voluntarily set free by that prince.</p>

<p>D. Fadrique de Toledo, the second duke of Alva, a son
of D. Garcia, was in his youth general of the Christian
forces on the frontiers of Grenada. He greatly signalized
himself in the war of Navarre, gathering a considerable
force to co-operate with the English, under the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
of the marquis of Dorset. To secure the pass into France,
he crossed the mountains and took St. John de Pie de
Puerto, which commanded the pass of Valderron&ccedil;as. The
king of Navarre succeeded, however, in effecting a passage
with his army through that of Valderron&ccedil;al, and J. Fernando
Valdez, and other commanders, amongst the mountains,
hemmed in the duke of Alva; but learning that the king of
Navarre was marching to invest Pampluna, the Duke resolved
to fling some succour into its citadel, and leaving the
castle of St. John under the command of James de Vera,
sallied out upon Valdez, and killing that general, succeeded,
with the loss of 400 men, in carrying his camp, and relieving
Pampluna.</p>

<p>His son, D. Garcia de Toledo, being employed in 1510,
with count Pedro Navarro, in a military expedition on
the coast of Africa, passed to the conquest of the Isle
of Gelves, and disembarking his men, penetrated into the
interior of that desert country. It was a season of such
excessive heat, that some of the soldiers dropped dead from
thirst, so that the whole army fell into disorder. D. Garcia
and the Count, however, cheered them on with fond
expressions, and such promises as the necessity of the case
required. They issued at length from the sands, and
entering thick groves of palm and olive trees, discovered
unexpectedly some wells of water, with many pitchers and
buckets attached to ropes. The eager desire of every one
to drink doubled the disorder, more particularly as there
was no enemy in sight; for the whole had been arranged
by the Moors, who secretly waited in a corner of the
wood, till the appearance of 4,000 foot and 200 horse,
when they rushed upon them with loud outcries, and casting
their darts, caused them to fly in the greatest confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
although many desired rather to drink than to fly, or even
live. Don Garcia seeing this, alighted, and with his pike
pricked forward many who had, betwixt despair and faintness,
cast themselves on the ground, and with every expression of
military endearment, endeavoured to animate them against
the Moors. With only fifteen around him, he attacked
the foe with such brave impetuosity, that they began to give
way, and if at this juncture he had been supported by the
rest, he would assuredly have furnished triumph instead of
tribulation to his country. But whilst Navarro was attempting
to bring back the fugitive troops, the Moors made a
fresh attack on his little band, wounded several, and killed
D. Garcia. His death doubled the terror and distress of
all, and notwithstanding that Navarro implored them with
tears to turn their faces, they fled with the utmost precipitation
to their vessels: and hence they still say in Castile,
'<i>Mother Gelves, the spell-word of misfortune!</i>'<a name="FNanchor_AU_47" id="FNanchor_AU_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_AU_47" class="fnanchor">[AU]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor Charles the Fifth, on the taking of Tunis,
discovered amongst the booty the arms of Don Garcia,
and presented them to his youthful son, afterwards the
celebrated duke of Alva. Pointing out to him the marks
of wounds received by his unfortunate parent, he exhorted
him to imitate his valour, but wished him a happier doom.
The duke received these arms with the most lively joy, and
caused them to be transported to Spain, and hung up in the
arsenal of the dukes of Alva.<a name="FNanchor_AV_48" id="FNanchor_AV_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_AV_48" class="fnanchor">[AV]</a></p>

<p>It happened that a gentleman of Burgos courted a lady
to whom Fernando of Alva also paid his addresses. It
was in the year 1524, when harquebusses were just coming
into use, but they were considered as very ungentlemanly
weapons to do slaughter with, by those who had been trained
to the exercises of the sword. This gentleman boasted that
he was a most excellent firer of the harquebuss, when, being
both in the presence of the lady, Fernando took out his
pocket handkerchief, and putting it to his nose, exclaimed,
"What an odious fume of powder there is in the room!"
at which the lady smiled greatly, and the gentleman's face
became overspread with blushes. Taking the duke afterwards
aside, he challenged him to meet him with sword
and capa, at a certain hour of the night, on the bridge
San Pablo. The duke arriving, his rival asked him what
arms he brought. "Sword and dagger." "I have but a
sword," rejoined the gentleman; whereupon the duke
threw his dagger into the river. They fought&mdash;were reconciled,
and agreed to conceal the duel; but it soon
became the theme of conversation, for on taking up their
mantles from the ground, they chanced to make an exchange;
and the duke, paying no attention to it, appeared in the
palace with his opponent's mantle, upon which were emblazoned
the arms of the Order of St. Jago, which led to a
discovery of the whole quarrel.</p>

<i>To the Flower of Gnido.</i></h3>

<p>The title of this Ode is derived from a quarter of the
city of Naples, called Il Seggio de Gnido, the favourite
abode then of people of fashion, in which also the lady
lived to whom the Ode was addressed. This lady, Violante
San Severino, a daughter of the duke of Soma, was courted
by Fabio Galeota, a friend of Garcilasso, in whose behalf
the poem was written. In the original, Garcilasso plays
upon the names of the parties, comparing the paleness of
the lover, not to the lily, but to the white <i>violet</i>, and
representing him as a <i>galley</i> slave in the boat, or, to speak
more poetically, the shell in which the Queen of Beauty
at her birth sailed along the ocean. If I have been guilty
of preserving any trace of this idle play upon words, it
is only that it has chimed in necessarily with the sense.
Mention is made by Sanchez, of an elegy addressed by Fabio
to Violante, beginning</p>

<i>In the fantastic pirouette.</i></h3>

<p>As none of the commentators of Garcilasso offer a word
in explanation of these verses, it was difficult to conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
exactly either to what they alluded, or what had given
rise to them. I find, however, in Bosc&aacute;n who has written
on the same text, a complete elucidation. They were
sported on Don Luis de la Cueva, for dancing in the palace
with a lady who was called La P&aacute;xara&mdash;<i>the bird</i>, probably
from the elegance with which she flew down the dance;<a name="FNanchor_AW_49" id="FNanchor_AW_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_AW_49" class="fnanchor">[AW]</a>
it would appear that D. Luis fell whilst attempting a
difficult step, and that in reply to the universal banter of
the assembly, he had unfortunately said, it was after all
no great crime in him to dance. This seems to have
excited great amusement, and to have set a number of
gentlemen, and some titled heads to work, to write bad
verses to prove the contrary. As, however, these verses show
some wit, and at the same time best serve to clear up the
obscurity of my author, I subjoin translations.</p>

<p>This is the only specimen extant of Garcilasso's Latin
compositions, which are spoken of by several writers of his
day as marked by extreme elegance, and amongst others by
Tansillo: nor can I close my volume, written in the hope
of placing in the clear light it deserves the merit of this
amiable poet, with more propriety and grace, than by adopting
the words of one who loved him for his virtues, and admired
him for his genius.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Mac&iacute;as was a gentleman of the Grand Master's, Don
Enrique de Villena. Among the ladies who attended on this
nobleman was one with whose beauty our poet became captivated;
and neither the seeing her married to another, the
reproofs of the Grand Master, nor, in fact, the prison into
which he ordered him to be consigned, could conquer his fatal
attachment. The husband, fired with wrath, concerted with
the alcaide of the tower in which his rival was imprisoned, and
found means to dart at him, through a window, the lance
he bore, and with it pierced him to the heart. Mac&iacute;as was
at that moment singing one of the songs he had composed
upon his mistress, and thus expired with her name and love
upon his lips. The two qualities of troubadour and lover
united in him, made him an object of celebrity, and almost
of reverence, with the poets of the age. Most of them
celebrated him, and his name, to which was joined the title of
<i>Enamorado</i>, is still proverbial, as a designation for devoted
lovers. The reader will not be displeased to see the verses
which Mena devoted to him in the <i>Laberinto</i>: they may serve
to show the character of that poet's fancy.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> These signs I think sufficient for my purpose. Whoso
desires yet farther proofs may compare the ode of Torre,
which begins "Sale de la sagrada," with the two canciones of
Quevedo, "Pues quitas primavera al a&ntilde;o el ce&ntilde;o," and
"Dulce se&ntilde;ora mia," placed in <i>Euterpe</i>, whence Velasquez
took the verses which he cites here and there in his discourse,
to prove the resemblance. He may do more; he may look in
<i>Melpomene</i> for the funeral Silva of the Turtle, and compare it
with the very beautiful cancion of Torre, to the same bird.
What a troublesome ingenuity, what exaggeration, what
hyperbole, what coldness in the first; what melancholy, tenderness,
and sentiment in the second! It is quite impossible that
the same object could produce an inspiration so different in the
same fancy. The example of Lope is cited, in the poetry of
Burguillos; but the real and absolute similarity that exists
between these verses and the diction of Lope and Burguillos,
notwithstanding the difference of subject and character, the
insinuation of Lope himself, that of Quevedo in his approbation
of the same poems, the conclusive authority of Montalban
and Antonio de Leon, friends and cotemporaries of Lope, who
attribute them to him, make the identity of Lope with
Burguillos as evident, as the reasons already alleged do the
diversity of Francisco de Torre and Quevedo.</p></div>

lifetime were contented with the title of his pupils, eclipsed him
in the scene, though his name was always respected as a writer.
This respect was, however, daily diminishing under a more
attentive observation of the principles of taste and of good
models, till the representation in later days of some of his
comedies with general applause served to re-establish his
tottering reputation. In France, a very good translation of
some of his poems, has within these few years been made by
the Marquis d'Aguilar; and in England, a man respectable
as well for rank and character as for learning, philosophy, and
taste (Lord Holland), has published an excellent essay and
criticism on his life and writings. A vicissitude sufficiently
singular; and which at least proves, that although Lope may
be a very faulty writer, he is yet very far from being an object
of but little interest in the history of Spanish literature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_U_21" id="Footnote_U_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_U_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> The author of that very delightful old work, half romance,
half history, Las Guerras Civiles de Granada, whence Bishop
Percy translated the ballad, "Gentle river, gentle river," has
introduced amongst others a <i>Romance</i> which perpetuates this
action; only that he attributes it to the father of Garcilasso the
poet, saying that it was performed by that personage in his
youth, during the siege of Granada by Ferdinand and Isabella.
But this is evidently a great mistake, as the surname De la
Vega is ascribed to the family in chronicles of a far earlier
time. This contradiction could not escape Lord Holland's
perspicacity; he makes mention of it in his life of Lope de
Vega, but seems somewhat disposed to doubt the truth of the
story altogether, as it is related, he observes, of another knight,
with little variation, in the Chronicle of Alonzo the Eleventh.
But I would say, with great deference to the judgment that
dictated this remark, that the popular ballads of a nation
generally take their rise from some event of commanding
interest, universally recognised at the time as true, and like our
own beautiful ballad of Chevy Chase, perpetuate the memory
thereof to long posterity, with the authority and assuredness of
history. The language of this ballad, it is true, precludes us
from giving it a date of greater antiquity than the author of the
above imaginative work; and it may be rational to suppose
that finding a Garcilasso at the siege of Granada, he chose to
embellish his book as well as his hero, by ascribing to him the
deed, known either from its mention in the chronicle or from
current tradition. But a full confirmation of the truth of the
story is, I think, to be found in the family arms; they bear, <i>or</i>,
the words <span class="smcap">Ave Maria, Gracia Plena</span>, per pale in letters
<i>azure</i>; and the house of Mendoza show the same words in their
scutcheon, only per pale a bend dexter, assumed, I am inclined
to think, on the marriage of D. Diego Hurtado de Mendoza
with Leonora de la Vega. I at one time thought that the
incident specified in the Chronicle of Alonzo the Eleventh,
might refer to the Garcilasso so favoured by that monarch,
more particularly as Mariana gives him the surname; but
subsequent research satisfies me in ascribing it to his son,
which I do on the authority of Sandoval. Appended to the
Chronicle of Alonzo the Wise in the British Museum, is a work
by this historian with MS. notes of his own, under this title:
Genealogies de algunos grandes Cavalleros que florecieron en
tiempo de Don Alonzo VII. Emperador de Espa&ntilde;a. Cuyos
descendientes ay oy dia A. D. 1600, por Fr. Prudencio de
Sandoval, predicador de la orden de San Benito. His words I
have translated in the text, and there is a MS. note in the
margin to much the same effect. I should have been glad to
give the incident alluded to by Lord Holland, but the chronicle
I consulted was printed so villanously in Gothic type, that it is
little wonder I missed finding it: the reader may not however
be displeased to see a translation of the
Romance.<a name="ENanchor_3" id="ENanchor_3"></a><a href="#Endnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

to represent Bosc&aacute;n, and that the word was formed from
an allusion to his name, Bosque&mdash;<i>nemus</i>, as that of Salicio is
an anagram of Garcilasso. Herrera was the first that combated
this opinion, applying the name to Don Antonio de
Fonseca, the husband of Donna Isabel Freyre, who died in
childbed. [Anotaciones, p. 409, 410.] From that time this became the prevailing supposition,
till D. Luis Zapata in his Miscellanea affirmed,
in contradiction of it, that Antonio de Fonseca was at no
time intimate with Garcilasso, whilst Bosc&aacute;n had been the
suitor, or servidor of Donna Isabel before her marriage,
to whom it is highly probable the verses in the first book
of his poems were addressed, beginning&mdash;</p>

<p>For my own part, setting aside the circumstance that Nemoroso,
in the second eclogue, in describing the urn of Tormes
passes a handsome eulogy on Bosc&aacute;n, a circumstance which
does not necessarily enter into the consideration, I am inclined
to believe that it was Bosc&aacute;n who was signified, and moreover,
that the eclogue was designed to commemorate the sadness
they both felt in the memory of their first loves.</p>

<p>"You will, perhaps, be inclined to laugh at the warmth with which I express
myself; but I feel that the not having good modern translations of <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>
and <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> is a disgrace to our literature, and conceive that we are only
debarred from this by Mr. Hoole's lumbering vehicle having so long
stopped the way."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stewart Rose's</span> <i>Letters from the North of Italy</i>.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a time rich beyond all former ages but that of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>,
and scarcely less prodigal than that in works of imagination; at
a period when our Poetry, following in the steps of our refinement
as a nation, and becoming, from the industry and success with
which it is cultivated, no less the theme of the aged than the
passion of the young,&mdash;whilst some superior intellects of the
day, in their thirst for distinction, are spending their great powers
on startling and vain experiments, it were surprising if there
were not some more willing to confine their ambition within the
boundaries of classical study, and, tracing the improvements
which English Poetry has undergone in its progress, to the
Tuscan Muses as their principal source, to explore, as their
adventure, the treasures confined under the golden key of Italian
language. Never has the inspiration of those Muses been
invoked without the most signal advantage, not only to our
literature, but our language. It softened, under <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>, the
Saxon roughness of our early tongue; it ruled and regulated the
cadences of <span class="smcap">Surrey</span> and <span class="smcap">Wyatt</span>, till from an uncouth and often
arbitrary metre, our Poetry grew into proportion, harmony, and
grace; it gave to the lyres of <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, <span class="smcap">Milton</span>, <span class="smcap">Collins</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Gray</span>, much of their compass, richness, and luxury of sound.
The advantages have indeed been such, and of so permanent a
nature, as to lead the historians of our literature to assert, that
all the grand renovations which have been made from time to
time in our Poetry, have either originally sprung from the Italian
school, or been promoted by it. Nor can the increasing taste for
Italian literature, spread by the excellent productions of <span class="smcap">Roscoe</span>,
<span class="smcap">Foscolo</span>, and <span class="smcap">Matthias</span>, nor the farther cultivation and extension
of it by Commentators and Translators, lead to less important
results.</p>

<p>But little, however, has yet been accomplished in giving to
England the Poets of Italy; and our writers may with justice
observe, that this neglect is a disgrace to our national literature.
If we except the Amynta of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>, recently given in a good
translation by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>; if we except <span class="smcap">Fanshaw's</span> old version
of <span class="smcap">Guarini's</span> Pastor Fido, so justly eulogised by Sir <span class="smcap">John
Denham</span>, <span class="smcap">Lloyd's</span> Alfieri, and the Dante of Mr. <span class="smcap">Carey</span>, where
shall we look for adequate pictures of her thousand Spirits of
Song? This deficiency has arisen from neglect, from disdain,
from any thing but inability. What Italy has been in the possession
of her <span class="smcap">Dantes</span>, her <span class="smcap">Ariostos</span>, her <span class="smcap">Petrarcas</span>, and her
<span class="smcap">Tassos</span>, England is in her <span class="smcap">Byrons</span>, her <span class="smcap">Scotts</span>, her <span class="smcap">Campbells</span>,
and her <span class="smcap">Moores</span>; not omitting others that have powers little less,
if at all inferior, who might, if they desired it, by Translations
almost as original in composition as are those glorious types
themselves, become at once personifications of their beauties,
and inheritors of their fame. The severe simplicity and wrathful
grandeur of <span class="smcap">Dante</span> is already transfused with spirit and condensity.
There is perhaps but one living poet possessed of an
equal versatility of talent, of the same various powers of passionate
description, fancy, wit, and whim, to transfuse the Proteus-spirit
of <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>, the Prince of Romancers; and but one gifted with
an equal feeling, melody, and charm of language, who could,
with a graceful hand, pour out music and lamentation from the
Urn of <span class="smcap">Petrarch</span>: but <i>they</i> could do it to the life; nor may it
be altogether a vain expectation that some of their future hours
will be consecrated to the service, and that their names will thus
become consociated in immortal brotherhood with the names of
these Patriarchs of Italian verse.</p>

<p>But if the writer does not calculate amiss, it is to a Translation
of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>,&mdash;of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>, who possesses much of the sublimity
and fervour, with nothing of the obscurity of <span class="smcap">Dante</span>,&mdash;the
romance and the picture, the fantasy and fire of <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span>,
without his eccentricity and caprice,&mdash;the melody, tenderness,
classical elegance, and transpicuousness of <span class="smcap">Petrarch</span>, without
his subtilty: of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>,&mdash;who, by the specific account of
<span class="smcap">Serassi</span>, his best biographer, had passed, at the time when he
was writing, through <i>one hundred and thirty</i> editions, and had
been translated into <i>twenty</i> languages and dialects of Europe,
that the liveliest sympathy is likely to be accorded, and the
greatest favour shown, by a People whose pride must be gratified
by the celebrity which he has given in his Poem to the exploits
of their ancestors, with minds sufficiently imaginative to abandon
themselves at will to the spells of his delightful genius, and with
hearts that cannot avoid taking a warm part in the generous
heroism of his Rinaldo and Tancred, in the enchanting beauty of
Armida, and the yet more interesting fortunes of his sensitive
Erminia.</p>

<p>In speaking of the ten former attempts that have been made to
give <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> an English dress, the writer has no desire to undervalue,
or unjustly to decry them,&mdash;they may all have been more
or less serviceable: he is admiringly alive to the harmonies and
graces of our most masculine <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>, as well as to the stoical
fidelity of antique <span class="smcap">Carew</span>; but he cannot be blind to their great
defects, still less can he shut his eyes upon those empiric pretensions
and empty performances of the Usurper of their honours,
which have led "the <span class="smcap">Ariosto</span> of the <span class="smcap">North</span>" (whom Britain
also tenaciously claims for her <span class="smcap">Boccaccio</span>) to observe with his
characteristic truth and humour, that "to rescue this charming
Poet from the <i>frozen paws</i> of poor Mr. <span class="smcap">Hoole</span>, would be to do
our literature a service at which he must rejoice." Stimulated
by the approbation accorded by his mighty mind, no less than by
that of other literary characters whom it would be ostentatious
to mention, the task commenced under favourable auspices, and
in which great progress is made, will be prosecuted with the
care and devotedness which so exquisite a poet demands, and
the nature of the measure chosen as most true to his genius, of
necessity enforces. It has been observed that Translation is but
little popular in England: to render it so with the mass of
readers it may be requisite to aim at giving it the air and charm
of original composition; but with the very many to whom the
Italian poem must be familiar, it cannot be doubted that their
pleasure must be doubled in having added to their contemplation
of the original their criticism of the artist, more particularly if,
as in the fine Translation of <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> from <span class="smcap">Schiller</span>,&mdash;that
criticism should fortunately derive gratification from his skill.
Neither is the <span class="smcap">Iliad</span> of <span class="smcap">Pope</span> unpopular, nor <span class="smcap">Sotheby's Oberon</span>,
nor any Translator who has trod with freedom and spirit in the
steps of the Master with whom he has endeavoured to identify
himself. But if the <i>name</i> of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span> should be insufficient to
bespeak attention to a project which cannot be perfected but
with great labour of thought, the Author will look for it in the
story and the subject, and believe it impossible but that those
who view with interest the present exertions of Christian Greece
against the Mussulman Ottomite, will still find emotion and
amusement in a transcript, though it may prove a too unworthy
one, of the celebrated pages in which all Europe stands in banner-array
against the despotic Ottomite of the Middle Ages, in a
land full of the most sacred recollections.</p>

THE SPECIMEN OF AN INTENDED NEW TRANSLATION,<br />

In English Spenserian Verse,<br />

<small>WITH<br />

A PREFATORY DISSERTATION ON EXISTING TRANSLATIONS.</small></p>

<p class="center">BY J. H. WIFFEN.</p>

<p class="center">PUBLISHED BY HURST, ROBINSON, AND CO.<br />

<small>90, CHEAPSIDE, AND 8, PALL MALL.</small></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><small>"There are certain ages in the history of the world, on which the heart dwells
with interest and affection; but there are none which excite our curiosity,
our admiration, and our love, more intensely than the days of
chivalry."&mdash;</small></p>

<p class="right close"><small><span class="smcap">Campbell.</span></small></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Il existe en Angleterre plusieurs traductions de la J&eacute;rusalem
D&eacute;livr&eacute;e; mais elles ont presque toutes de grands d&eacute;fauts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
Celle de <span class="smcap">Hoole</span> est sans contredit la plus mauvaise. <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>
en a publi&eacute; une o&ugrave; l'on rencontre de tr&egrave;s-beaux passages, &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute;
de choses triviales; il franchit souvent l'espace qui s&eacute;pare le
sublime du ridicule. M. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span> a publi&eacute; une traduction du
po&egrave;me du <span class="smcap">Tasse</span>, mais la mesure de vers qu'il a adopt&eacute;e ne
convient point au po&egrave;me h&eacute;roique, et nuit &agrave; l'effet g&eacute;n&eacute;ral: on
peut aussi lui reprocher d'&ecirc;tre diffus, et de ne pas toujours
choisir le tour le plus neuf et le plus concis. M. <span class="smcap">Wiffen</span>,
si l'on en juge d'apr&egrave;s l'essai qu'il offre au public, est appel&eacute;
&agrave; faire enfin passer les beaut&eacute;s du po&egrave;te Italien dans la langue
Anglaise. Sa traduction, &eacute;l&eacute;gante et fid&egrave;le, a parfois le charme
et la magie des vers du <span class="smcap">Tasse</span>: on voit qu'il s'est d'abord
p&eacute;n&eacute;tr&eacute; des pens&eacute;es de son mod&egrave;le, afin de parvenir &agrave; les rendre
sans les d&eacute;naturer, comme cela n'arrive que trop souvent aux
traducteurs vulgaires."&mdash;<i>La Revue Encyclop&eacute;dique de Paris</i>,
Avril, 1822.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, we must state our opinion, that this Specimen
is highly creditable to the taste and talents of Mr. <span class="smcap">Wiffen</span>.
He possesses strong powers of versification, which are absolutely
necessary to a translator of <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>, and he manifests a warm
and vigorous imagination. His acquaintance with poetical
phraseology, also, is various and extensive. A poet himself,
he is delighted with his labour, and appears, like Ariel, to do
'his spiriting gently.' The task which he has undertaken is most
difficult and arduous, on which the highest minds might enter
with diffidence and distrust: but Mr. W. certainly has the
power of producing a work which will be honourable to the
literature of his country and to his own fame; and we hope
he may meet with the encouragement which the attempt
deserves."&mdash;<i>Monthly Review</i>, June, 1821.</p>

<p>"The present Specimen is prefaced by a sensible and liberal
criticism on the merits of those who have preceded the Translator
in this great work. The pretensions of <span class="smcap">Hoole</span>, which, to the
astonishment of all who are acquainted with the subject, have
been so long suffered to pass unquestioned, are ably and judiciously
exposed; and the version of <span class="smcap">Fairfax</span>, so much talked of,
and so little known, receives the tribute of praise which is its
due, unmixed, however, with any portion of that slavish admiration
which mistakes blemishes for beauties, and want of taste for
exuberance of genius. The result of Mr. <span class="smcap">Wiffen's</span> inquiry
is inevitable&mdash;that a new Translation is necessary, and that at
present we possess none which gives any adequate idea of the
original. * * * * * But we must set limits
to our extracts. Indeed, we should transcribe the whole
Pamphlet, if we were to show all that has pleased and delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
us. The whole is splendidly and powerfully written, and the
sense and style of the original scrupulously preserved. Some of
the extracts we have given, beautifully as they are versified, are
almost literal transcripts from <span class="smcap">Tasso</span>. Most sincerely do we
congratulate Mr. <span class="smcap">Wiffen</span> on the success of his labours, and we
hope that it will not be long before he fully realizes the hopes
which so promising a specimen must necessarily excite."&mdash;<i>Monthly
Magazine</i>, April, 1821.</p>

<p>"Upon the whole, we have never met with a translation
possessing more of the spirit and interest of the original; and we
can confidently recommend it to our readers as a work abounding
with merit, and likely to add much to the already well-earned
reputation of its author. Mr. Wiffen possesses a genuine vein of
his own, and has given to the present work a life and intrinsic
interest very seldom met with in productions of this class. He
displays a fervency, an enthusiasm, an instinct of beauty, a
seriousness of tone and manner, which accord admirably with the
spirit of his author. We have no hesitation in affirming, that
very many of his stanzas equal the originals in every thing but the
language; and we think we could point out more than one or
two that are absolutely superior."&mdash;<i>Investigator</i>, April, 1823.</p>
